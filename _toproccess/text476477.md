        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An interesting case where a <a href="textP.htm"> surimono
        </a> was
        produced for a play that was advertised but never performed. <i>Kagekiyo</i>
        was announced to open at the Ichimura theatre on the 9th day of the
        first month of 1827 with Danjuro VII as Taira no Kagekiyo, and
        Mitsugoro III as Hatakeyama Shigetada. However, the theatre burned
        down a few days before the opening and Danjuro VII was
        immediately recruited to perform at the <a href="KUN/kunp475474htm.htm"> Kawarazaki theatre</a> in <i>Sato no
        haru meibutsu amigasa</i> (Famous sedge hats during spring in Yoshiwara).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kagekiyo was the subject of several of
        the Eighteen Plays (<i>Kabuki Juhachiban</i>) selected by
        Danjuro VII as specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage
        of actors. Head samurai of the Taira clan, he was often presented as a
        master of the narrow escape, particularly in his failed attempts to
        assassinate Minamoto Yoritomo, head of the Genji clan. In this scene he
        disguises himself as a monk-soldier of the Todaiji temple in Nara,
        and waits for a chance to attack Yoritomo who is behind the curtain in
        the Great Buddha Hall officiating at the dedication of the newly
        restored temple in 1195. At this moment Yoritomo's vassal, Shigetada,
        sees through the disguise. The design on the curtain and on Shigetada's
        robe is the symbol of the Genji; the design on his pantaloons is
        Mitsugoro's symbol.</font></p>
        <font FACE="Arial">
        <p><font size="2">The printing of this surimono employs a variety of
        exquisite effects, including the embossing of the texture of the
        billowing curtain, the metallic pigments on the armour, and the flecked
        pattern on the stone pavement which was sprayed through a bamboo straw.
        On some other impressions the seal of the printer Shunfudo
        Ryucho appears.</font></font>
