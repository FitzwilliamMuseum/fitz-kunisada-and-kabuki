      <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">From a set of five<a href="textP.htm"> surimono
      </a> commissioned for
      the Hisakataya poetry group whose emblem, a stylised <i>koto</i> bridge,
      surmounts the red inscription: <i>Goban-tsusuki</i> (from a set of five).
      The printer's seal of <i>Ryusai</i> <i>Chimata</i> (Ino Naojiro) also
      appears on the print. The set depicts characters from the cycle of plays
      telling of the <a href="Group6.htm"> revenge of the two Soga brothers</a>, Soga no Juro and Soga
      no Goro, on their father's murderer Kudo Suketsune.
      <p>The <i>Iori-mokko</i> motif (a magnolia within a stylised hut)
      associated with Kudo Suketsune<i> </i>decorates the curtain looped across
      the top of all five prints in the series. It also occurs on the curtain on
      the <i>Shimadai</i> (island tray) decoration held by Oiso no Tora in this
      print. The motif alludes to Suketsune's hunting lodge at Susono below
      Mount Fuji, where he was finally murdered by the Soga brothers. Soga no
      Juro's costume bears the pattern of flying-plovers (<i>chidori</i>) that
      was traditionally associated with him, while his sleeve is decorated with
      the <i>Yamagata-mokko</i> motif of Soga. His mistress Tora's costume is
      decorated with a Soga butterfly motif, which was also associated with the
      actor Kumesaburo</font>
