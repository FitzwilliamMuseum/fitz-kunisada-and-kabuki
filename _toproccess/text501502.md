      <p>Two sheets from a set of five <a href="textP.htm"> surimono</a> showing a scene from one of the
      Eighteen Plays (<i>Kabuki Juhachiban</i>) selected by Danjuro VII as
      specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage of actors. The missing
      central sheet shows Danjuro VII playing the role of Sukeroku. The print
      probably records a performance in Osaka, where these actors were present
      for New Year of 1830. Their journey from Edo is reflected in the imagery
      of the poems. The missing outer sheets show the villain Ikkyu (right) and
      the noodle-seller Fukeroku (left).</p>
      <p>Sukeroku is in reality Soga no Goro, while Shimbei is his elder
      brother, Soga no Juro, who is posing as a sake seller (although he still
      wears a costume decorated with the flying-plovers pattern associated with
      Soga no Juro). Sukeroku learns that his missing heirloom sword
      Tomokirimaru is in the possession of Ikkyu, the villainous patron of
      Sukeroku's secret lover Agemaki, who is a Yoshiwara courtesan. He
      subsequently wins the sword back in a fight in which Ikkyu is killed, and
      escapes with the help of Agemaki.</p>
      <p>A poem by Ryuotei Edo no Hananari on the sheet depicting Kumesaburo
      alludes to irises, one of his symbols, while the reference to Edo purple (<i>murasaki</i>)
      also alludes to the purple headband worn by Sukeroku in this play:</p>
      <i>
      <p>Lovely coloured strands<br>
      of iris flowers<br>
      purple as Edoflow in streams to Naniwa [Osaka]<br>
      and knot Agemaki's robes.<br>
      <br>
      </i>A poem by Ryukatei Fushi Mizugaki on the sheet depicting Kikugoro
      puns on the word for plum blossom (<i>bai</i>), which is associated with
      Osaka and also forms the first character of <i>Baiko</i> ('Plum luck'),
      the actor's poetry name. The other poem by Ryuotei Edo no Hananari puns
      on the actor's family name Onoe, which means 'peak', while the mention of
      sake alludes to Shimbei's guise as a sake seller:</p>
      <i>
      <p>His beauty<br>
      like an alluring fragrance<br>
      drifts to another place;<br>
      our elder brother flourishes<br>
      in the Naniwa [Osaka] spring<br>
      <br>
      Admired by all -<br>
      the best in three capitals! -<br>
      Onoe, like the peak of Fuji<br>
      covered with snow<br>
      made of white sake.</i></font>
