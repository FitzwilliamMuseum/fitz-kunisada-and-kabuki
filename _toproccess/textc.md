        <p>T<font size="2">he artist who is the subject of this exhibition used
        a number of names in the course of his long career. His family name was
        Sumida but he never used it in his work, employing instead two
        professional names. His first professional name, <b>Kunisada,</b> was
        bestowed on him at the start of his career by his teacher Utagawa
        Toyokuni (1769�1825). He signed all of his work Kunisada from 1807
        until 1844, when he assumed his teacher's professional name, <b>Toyokuni</b>.
        He announced this name-change by signing numerous prints issued in
        1844/45 with the signature 'Kunisada changing to Toyokuni II'. In doing
        so he rejected the use of the name by Tokokuni's son-in-law Toyoshige
        between Toyokuni's death in 1825 and Toyoshige's death in 1835.
        (Nowadays Toyoshige is usually called <i>Toyokuni II</i>, and Kunisada <i>Toyokuni

        professional names, Japanese artists employed numerous art names (<i>go</i>).
        In signing his prints Kunisada often preceded his professional name (<b>Kunisada</b>
        or <b>Toyokuni</b>) with one of the following art names: <b>Gototei</b>
        (used only with Kunisada), <b>Kochoro</b> (used with
        Kunisada and Toyokuni); and <b>Ichiyosai</b> (used only with
        Toyokuni). Kunisada sometimes varied his signature when signing prints
        in a set or even the sheets of a triptych. He also usually added the
        suffix <b><i>ga</i></b> (drawn by), and in the last decade of his life, <b><i>hitsu</i></b>
