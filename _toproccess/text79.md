      oshi-e kagami</a> </i>(Up-to-date
      Padded Pictures in Mirrors). Kunisada designed several series of portraits
      of actors reflected in mirrors. Six prints from this series are included
      in this exhibition.</font></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kajiwara Kagetoki was a 12th-century
      warrior who deserted the Heike clan to join the Genji. Often depicted as a
      villain, he was the hero of the play premiered in 1730 as <i>Miura no
      Osuke kobai tazuna</i>, the third act of which is still performed today
      and tells how Kagetoki proves the power of a Genji heirloom sword.</font></p>
      <font FACE="Arial">
      <p><font size="2">In contrast to the <a href="KUN/kunp78.htm">other prints</a>
      included in this exhibition, this example is not from a luxury edition; it
      is printed with cheaper colours on thinner paper, without special
      additional printing effects such as embossing and burnishing. No
      block-carver's seal appears on the print.</font></font>
