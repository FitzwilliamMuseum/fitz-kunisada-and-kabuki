      <font face="Arial" size="2">From an untitled set of over forty actor
      portraits, each reflected in a round mirror resting in a lacquer case,
      with a poem from the actor's own brush inscribed above the mirror.
      Kunisada had previously used a round-mirror format in the early 1820s for
      a set of beauties reflected in round hand-mirrors. In the late 1820s he
      applied the format to actor portraiture for the first time in this set,
      which was issued over a number of years. It was Kunisada's largest set of
      actor portraits before the late 1840s, and included many lesser-known
      performers in addition to stars. He used this<a href="Group11.htm"> mirror
      format </a>again for sets of actor-portraits in the late 1840s and late
      1850s.The hero Sato Masakiyo (actually the historical figure Kato
      Kiyomasa) is shown in the 'Poisoned Sake' (Dokushu) scene of the play: he
      has been forced into a position where he must take a slow-acting but fatal
      poison in place of his lord, Oda Haruwaka (actually Toyotomi Hideyori), in
      order to protect him. The title of the play refers to another act of the
      play in which Honjo Castle in Kumamoto is attacked by Tomimasa
      (actually Tokugawa Ieyasu). The identity of such historical characters was
      disguised to avoid infringing the ban on their portrayal on stage or in
      prints.</font>
