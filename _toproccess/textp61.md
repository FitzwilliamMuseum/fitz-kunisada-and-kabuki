      <p><font size="2">Portrait of <a href="Group12.htm"> Ichikawa Danjuro VIII</a> as
      <a href="Group6.htm"> Soga no
      Goro,</a> from the series Mitate juni-ka-getsu (Comparisons with the
      Twelve Months).</font></font><font FACE="Arial">
      <p><font size="2">The portrait is depicted as though the face is painted
      on a lantern, and is accompanied by an inset designed by
      Kunisada II (1823-80) showing a figure running in a sudden evening shower.
      Plays telling of the <a href="Group6.htm">revenge</a> taken by the Soga no
      Goro and his brother Soga no Juro on their father's murderer were
      traditionally performed at New Year, but there were also quick-change
      dance pieces (<i>henge mono</i>) devoted to single characters, which were
      performed at other times of year. One of these was <i>Ame no Goro</i>
      ('Rainfall Goro') or <i>Tokimune</i> first created in 1841 for a festival
      honouring the Soga brothers. Its story involves Goro's visit to the pleasure
      quarters to visit his mistress during a rain-storm. He wears a richly-embroidered robe with
      the butterfly motif associated with the character, and the sort of red make-up (<i>beni
      guma</i>) and wild-haired wig typical of the <i>aragoto</i>
      ('rough-stuff') roles specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage of
      actors.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Each actor in this series is matched with a month; the
      connection in this print may be that the revenge in the Soga story took
      place in the fifth month. The iris is the symbol of the Fifth Month.</font></font>
