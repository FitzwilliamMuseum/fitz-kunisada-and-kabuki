      <font FACE="Arial"><font size="2">From the series <i><a href="KUN/kun113.htm">Tosei jihitsu kagami</a></i>
      (Mirror of Contemporary Autographs), published 12/1861, with portraits by
      Kunisada juxtaposed against landscapes or still-lifes. This print,
      published in 11/1861, was one of several designed by Kunisada in
      connection with the same production, three of which are included in this
      exhibition. Here the villain Matsuo-maru appears in the scene called <i>Kuruma
      biki</i> (Pulling the carriage apart), which the Kabuki version had added
      to the original puppet play. The stage setting is conjured up in the <i>hokku</i>
      poem, signed in imitation of the actor's own calligraphy, which appears to
      the left on the <i>tanzaku</i> (long poem card) decorated with pine needle
      and cone motifs:</font><i>
      <p><font size="2">Kamigaki ya </font></i><font size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </i>Within the shrine
      fence</font></p>
      <i>
      <p><font size="2">yo no ki wa nakute </font></i><font size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </i>none of the
      other trees</font></p>
      <i>
      <p><font size="2">matsu no hana&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font></i><font size="2">is as flowery as
      the pine.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The poem puns on the word <i>matsu</i>, 'pine', which
      forms part of the name of <i>Matsu</i>o-maru. The scene is set at Yoshida
      Shrine in Kyoto, with stage props usually including a <i>torii</i> gate, a
      low red <i>kamigaki</i> shrine fence (as mentioned in the poem), and
      cherry (<i>sakura</i>) and plum (<i>ume</i>) trees in reference to the
      names of Matsuo-maru's triplet brothers, <i><a href="KUN/kunp86.htm">Sakura</a></i><a href="KUN/kunp86.htm">-maru and <i>Ume</i>o-maru.</a>
      By comparing the trees, the poem also suggests that the role of Matsuomaru
      is more prominent than the others in this play.</font></font>
