      commemorating the performance in the ninth month of 1832 at the Kawarazaki
      Theatre in Edo of <i>Sugawara denju tenarai kagami</i> (Sugawara and the
      secrets of calligraphy). The print shows the <i>Tempaizan</i> scene at
      Mount Tempai on Kyushu, where the exiled Sugawara, known as Kan
      Shojo, learns in a dream that his favourite plum tree from the
      garden in his home in Sada village has been moved to nearby Anraku Temple
      so that he may enjoy its blossoms. When he goes there he encounters one of
      his retainers, Umeomaru, involved in a duel. He breaks off a branch
      from the tree and magically decapitates Umeomaru's opponent. He then
      learns from Umeomaru that his loss of position at court and
      subsequent exile are due to the machinations of his rival Shihei (Fujiwara
      Tokihira). Flying into a rage he turns into the Thunder god, raises a
      storm and, to the accompaniment of lightning, flies off to the capital
      (Kyoto) to muster support in preventing Shihei from gaining power.</font><font FACE="Arial">
      <p><font size="2">The print conflates the scene of the duel with Kan
      Shojo's transformation into the Thunder God. The poems include
      images of blossoms of plum (<i>umeo</i>), and Umeomaru's jacket
      is decorated with the flower. Kan Shojo was one of
      Danjuro's most celebrated roles. Almost twenty years earlier
      Kunisada designed a print of him in the role with the branch of plum
      blossom clenched between his teeth, in a set of 'Great Performances'.</font></font><b><i><font FACE="Arial"></font></i></b>
