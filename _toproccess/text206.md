      <font size="2" face="Arial">Nakamura Shikan II was primarily an Osaka actor but he
      worked for extended periods in Edo. His first sojourn in Edo ran from 1828
      to 1833. At the end of 1833 Kunisada marked his departure from Edo by
      designing this print. This is as much a fashion plate as a commemorative
      print. Shikan II is shown dressed in the latest fashion of the town before
      the sedan chair that will carry him away. His accoutrements are
      meticulously rendered, while his pose is identical to those encountered in
      Kunisada�s prints of beautiful women of this period. To the right,
      resting on his trunk, is a rush basket, reminding us of the low legal
      status of actors in Tokugawa Japan: actors, along with criminals, were
      required to wear such baskets over their heads when passing along city
      streets.</font>
