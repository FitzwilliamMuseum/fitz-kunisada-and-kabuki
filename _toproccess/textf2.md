        PRINTS&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>
        <p><font size="2">Kunisada, like all of his contemporaries, designed a
        large number of fan prints. The greater portion of these portrayed
        actors. Printed fans were popular and inexpensive fashion accessories.
        As a result few have survived the wear and tear of ordinary use and
        today fans are the rarest of all categories of 19th-century prints.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Fan prints were either in the folding fan <u>(</u><i>ogi</i>)
        or in the oval fan <u>(</u><i>uchiwa</i><u>)</u> format. All of Kunisada's
        known fan prints are in the oval format, although he occasionally used
        the folding fan format as a framing device in standard actor prints.
        Kunisada responded to the challenge of the fan's shape (and to other
        irregular shapes such as the battledore) with ingenious designs that
        make a virtue of the potentially awkward format.</font></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
