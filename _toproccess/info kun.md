        <p><font size="2"><a href="textC.htm">Kunisada </a> (1786-1865) was the most prolific and
        commercially-successful of all woodblock print designers. Although he
        designed many prints of <a href="KUN/kun022.htm">beauties</a>, Kabuki actors were his main speciality
        and formed about 70% of his output. <i>Part 1</i> of this exhibition
        features commercially-published actor prints from the 1820s and 30s,
        when Kunisada established a style distinct from that of his teacher
        Utagawa <a href="textC.htm">Toyokuni.</a> <i>Part 2</i> comprises prints from the period after
        1844 when he adopted his master's name and signed himself 'Toyokuni'.
        These later prints are more complex in design, and are shown here in
        'luxury' impressions on thick paper with <a href="textP.htm"> special printing
        effects</a>: the
        reflective gleam of metallic pigments and mica; three-dimensional
        patterns embossed without using ink (<i>karazuri</i>); and shining
        patterns produced by burnishing the printed surface with a piece of
        ivory or tooth (<i>tsuyazuri</i>). Such costly effects were also used in
        the privately-issued prints known as <i>surimono</i> (literally 'printed
        matter'), which form <i>Part 3</i> of this exhibition. <i>Surimono</i>
        combine images and poems and were often commissioned by poetry clubs
        associated with actors and artists, and sometimes by the actors
        themselves. Kunisada's <i>surimono</i> were mainly produced in the 1820s
        and 30s and were almost entirely devoted to Kabuki subjects;<a href="Group9.htm"> several

        <p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">Kabuki theatre was the most vibrant
        manifestation of the extraordinary 'floating world' of pleasure that
        developed under the military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogun during
        the Edo period (1603-1868). The floating world (<i>ukiyo</i>) centred around
        the Yoshiwara licensed pleasure district in Edo (now Tokyo), where
        samurai could step outside their normal roles in the rigid hierarchy of
        feudal society, and mix with the newly-wealthy urban commoners (<i>chonin</i>).
        It was the woodblock printing industry, with its technical facility to
        combine text and image, which gave the floating world its cohesion and
        spread its influence. By Kunisada's day, the ukiyo-e print had developed
        into a mass-produced popular art. Commercially-published prints were
        issued in editions of several thousand and were relatively cheap. A
        normal-size (<i>oban</i>) print cost twenty mon, about the same as a haircut or
        an inexpensive meal, and about half as much as the cheapest Kabuki
        ticket. Kabuki fans from all strata of society could therefore buy
        prints of their favourite actors in the latest plays, and paste them on
        their walls and screens. Accordingly the prints were nearly always
        published to coincide with particular performances and were intended to
        be sold immediately and enjoyed briefly. Yet their success was more
        lasting and a proportion survived in collectors' albums. Besides the
        allure of the actors depicted, the prints could be appreciated on
        various levels. The technical finesse of the<a href="textP.htm"> surimono and 'luxury'
        printings,</a> and the subtle visual and literary references that cloaked
        modern subjects in the rich fabric of Japan's legendary and poetic past,
        appealed to a discerning and sophisticated audience, including the
        writers, artists and actors who were leading players in the floating
        world.

        Kabuki</font></b>
        <p><font size="2">Kabuki originated at the start of the Edo period and
        developed into an elaborate stage spectacle with complex plots and
        spectacular productions. Although there were also thriving theatres in
        Kyoto and Osaka, Edo (Tokyo) was the major centre with three licensed
        main theatres designated as the <i>Edo sanza</i> ('Edo's three
        theatres'): the Ichimura, Morita and <a href="textB.htm"> Nakamura.</a> Because of recurring
        financial problems, the Morita theatre was periodically closed (1819-22,
        1823-33, 1837-56) and productions were then staged instead at the
        Kawarazaki Theatre. As part of the Tempo Reforms the theatres were
        all relocated in 1841/2 to an area near Asakusa Temple that was renamed <a href="textA.htm">
        Saruwaka Street.</a><br>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2">The season ran from the 11th month to
        the 10th month. The first run of performances, from the 1st day of the
        11th month to the 10th day of the 12th month, was known as the <i>kaomise</i>
        ('face-showing'), as it introduced that theatre's newly-engaged actors
        for the season. This was followed by: the new Year or early spring run (<i>hatsuharu</i>)
        starting on the 15th day of the 1st month; the main spring run (<i>yayoi</i>)
        starting on the 3rd day of the 3rd month; the <i>satsuki</i> run
        starting on the 5th day festival in the 5th month; the summer (<i>natsu</i>)
        or <i>bon</i> run starting on the 15th day of the 7th month at the time
        of the <i>bon</i> festival of the dead, when the main actors were on
        holiday and performances were undertaken by younger actors; and finally
        the autumn (<i>aki</i>) or farewell (<i>onagori</i>) run starting on the
        9th day of the 9th month. Certain plays were linked with particular
        seasons for performance: the various plays telling the story of the
        revenge of the <a href="Group6.htm"> Soga brothers</a> were traditionally performed at New Year (<i>hatsuharu</i>);<a href="Group5.htm">
        <i>Sukeroku yukari no Edo sakura</i>   (Sukeroku's affinity for the cherry
        blossoms of Edo) </a> was popular in spring (<i>yayoi</i>) when cherry
        blossoms were blooming; plays with a child separation scene such as <i><a href="Group3.htm">Sugawara
        denju tenarai kagami </a> </i><a href="Group3.htm">(Sugawara and the secrets of calligraphy)</a> was
        popular for the farewell performance in autumn (<i>aki</i>).<br>
        Performances continued all day, with some acts serving as comic or dance
        interludes (<i>kyogen</i>). Plays fell into two broad categories:
        historical tales, such as the <a href="Group6.htm"> Soga plays, </a> and contemporary domestic
        dramas. Even when the story was a historical subject derived from the
        puppet theatre, like <i><a href="Group3.htm">Sugawara denju tenarai kagami
        </a> </i><a href="Group3.htm">(Sugawara and
        the secrets of calligraphy),</a> or from classical <i>no</i> drama, it
        was usually furnished with an amorous subplot, frequently set in the
        Yoshiwara. Kabuki derived many other elements from the ritual world of <i>no</i>,
        including aspects of staging, dance and stylised posture.<a href="Group2.htm"> Elaborate face
        make-up, wigs and costume patterns became associated with particular
        roles.</a> Most plays were structured around critical dramatic moments when
        the individual is trapped between a merciless moral code and his or her
        personal feelings; the action freezes and actors literally screw
        themselves up to a high pitch of dramatic tension with limbs held rigid
        and eyes crossed. These startling poses (<i>mie</i>) were ideally suited
        for artists to capture in <i>ukiyo-e</i>  prints.

        icons, and their<a href="textD.htm"> near-legendary names</a> passed from one generation to
        another. Stars such as <a href="Group8pt1.htm"> Danjuro VII </a> had massive fan clubs and
        supplemented their huge earnings by endorsing products with their names.
        The ban on women performers, first enforced in 1629 to discourage
        licentiousness, meant that<a href="textG.htm"> female roles,</a> frequently intended to
        represent the most beautiful courtesans, had to be taken by male actors.
        These specialists took their female impersonations so seriously that
        they continued to play the part of a woman in their lives outside the
        theatre, going so far as to enter the women's side of public bathhouses.
        Leading female impersonators (<a href="textG.htm">onnagata</a>) such as <a href="Group7.htm">Segawa
        Kikunojo V</a> and <a href="Group8pt1.htm">Iwai Kumesaburo II</a> became

        <p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">Despite the complete mixture of classes
        attending Kabuki, the hierarchical distinctions of society at large were
        reinforced by government censorship. In 1842 the government made an
        example of <a href="textE.htm"> Danjuro VII</a> by banishing him from Edo as a punishment for the
        luxurious lifestyle that he pursued in his <a href="KUN/infovol2.htm"> ostentatious villa.</a> Another
        decree that year was aimed at ukiyo-e print publishers: 'To make
        woodblock prints of Kabuki actors, courtesans and geisha is detrimental
        to public morals. Henceforth the publication of new works [of this kind]
        as well as the sale of previously procured stocks is strictly forbidden.
        In future you are to select designs that are based on loyalty and filial
        piety and which serve to educate women and children, and you must insure
        that they are not luxurious.' Accordingly the number of colour blocks in
        a print was restricted to eight; and the price of prints was limited to
        sixteen mon in order to restrain their luxury. By 1850, most of these
        regulations were relaxed and Danjuro VII returned to Edo. Although the
        letter of the law remained in force, publishers subverted it by
        identifying actor portraits as exemplary 'Loyal Heroes' or <a href="KUN/kunp69.htm"> 'Immortal
        Poets'</a> of legend. In any case, the prints played such allusive games
        with words and pictures that their web of meaning floated outside the
        control of the censors. The final years of the Tokugawa shogunate
        actually resulted in some of the most sumptuous prints ever designed, as
        the latest stars of the Kabuki stage appeared in dizzying concoctions
        laced with historical and literary conceits, in unprecedented
        combinations of high-colour printed with intoxicating effects from as
        many as twenty blocks. This opulence of production aptly reflects the
        sensational aesthetic of the Kabuki stage.<br>
