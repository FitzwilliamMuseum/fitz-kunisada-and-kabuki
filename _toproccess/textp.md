        SPECIAL PRINTING EFFECTS&nbsp;</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        All the prints illustrated on this website are colour prints from
        multiple woodblocks. The category of Japanese woodblock print known as
        surimono, meaning literally 'printed thing', was distinguished from most
        of the other prints in several ways: surimono were privately
        commissioned and distributed rather than being issued by a commercial
        publisher; they were printed on thicker paper�<i>hosho</i> ('presentation
        paper')�which facilitated special printing effects; and they were
        consistently adorned with poems that played games with the links between
        verbal and visual imagery. By comparison with run-of-the-mill commercial
        issues, surimono were a luxury that displayed the wealth and taste of
        the individual or individuals who commissioned them. For the artist they
        represented high-profile commissions executed in close consultation with
        the leading connoisseurs, poets and actors of the day.
        <p>Kunisada was actively involved in the production of surimono from the
        late 1810s to the middle years of the 1830s, when an economic crisis
        brought a halt to such indulgent luxuries. It is estimated that he
        designed at least 300, most of which were devoted to kabuki actors. He
        exploited the richness of the format to produce prints of extraordinary
        elegance and opulence. His surimono include many of the finest prints he
        designed in this period, which coincided with the flowering of surimono
        in Edo (present day Tokyo), particularly in the square <a href="KUN/kunp491.htm"> <i> shikishiban</i></a>
        format. Like all surimono formats, <i> shikishiban</i> was a division of the
        standard <i> hosho</i> sheet: a <i> hosho</i> sheet divided into six forms
        <i> shikishiban</i>
        sheets. Most <i> shikishiban</i> prints were <i> kyoka</i> surimono, commissioned by
        members of the large <i> kyoka</i> ('crazy-verse') poetry groups (<i>gawa</i>) or
        smaller poetry circles (<i>ren</i>), who would swap surimono at poetry
        gatherings. Other individuals commissioned surimono as private greeting
        cards or mementoes of particular events for distribution among their
        friends or clients. They were often produced at New Year, with suitable
        poems auguring good luck accompanying seasonal spring imagery or symbols
        of longevity. Kabuki actors commissioned surimono to distribute among
        their sponsors and fans. The fans themselves also commissioned surimono
        to extol the virtues of their favourite actor. In Kunisada's surimono of
        actors, a particular performance or role is often commemorated, just as
        it is in the commercial prints.</p>
        <p>The production of surimono was more complex than that of standard
        commercial prints; accordingly the name of the 'producer' or 'printer'
        is sometimes recorded on the print. In some cases there were even
        specialist studios headed by artists, which produced surimono for other
        artists. For instance, the studio of Kubo Shumman produced several
        surimono to Kunisada's designs, and the <a href="KUN/kunp493.htm"> Shumman seal
        </a> appears on the
        prints.</p>
        <p>There were various types of special printing on surimono: <a href="KUN/kunp491detail2b.htm"> blind
        embossing</a> of the paper from specially cut blocks without ink (<i>karazuri</i>),
        using ivory or bone to press precise patterns into the paper; embossing
        the surface of the paper with the texture of a textile glued on the
        block (<i>nunome-zuri</i>); burnishing the surface after printing to make it
        glossy (<i>tsuya-zuri</i> ), especially in black areas to suggest a glossy wig
        or black silk collar, or to introduce an extra pattern into coloured
        areas; <a href="KUN/kunp491detail.htm"> metallic pigments</a>, often brass, which reflect light; pigment
        sprayed through a straw to give a speckled effect; white pigment
        splashed or flicked with a brush onto the printed surface, often to
        depict snow or the spray of water; pigment sprayed through a bamboo
        straw to give a speckled effect. Many of these effects are only visible
        when the surimono is held in the hand and moved around in the light.
        They tease the eye, delight and surprise, in the same way that the poems
        and images delight and surprise as their various allusive meanings are
        teased out.</p>
        <p>Costly printing effects were also used in the <a href="KUN/kunp73.htm"> best impressions</a> of the
        commercial prints produced towards the end of Kunisada's career in the
        period when he was using the Toyokuni signature. In addition, materials
        and techniques that had been used in the lavish printings of prints and
        books at the end of the previous century were also used, such as the
        sprinkling of mica dust (<i>kira</i>) to sparkle in the light, and the addition
        of animal glue (<i>niwaka</i>) to the burnished black to give the effect of
        lacquer. The prints sometimes bear the name of the block-cutter or
        printer as well as the artist. These luxury impressions of Kunisada's
        prints of the 1850s and 60s must have been substantially more expensive
        than the impressions of the same subjects that were printed (presumably
        in much larger number) without the special printing effects and on
        thinner, cheaper paper. Presumably they were aimed at a more
        sophisticated clientele, perhaps collectors who would keep these luxury
        prints in albums rather than paste them on walls and then discard them.
        These later, luxury prints often come quite close to surimono in effect,
        particularly in the actor portraits that include poems, and they were
        evidently aimed at collectors with comparable wealth and refined taste.</p>
