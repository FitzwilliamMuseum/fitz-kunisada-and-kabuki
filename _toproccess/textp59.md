      of a series of memorial portraits (<i><a href="KUN/kun214.htm">tsuizen-e</a></i>)<i> </i>of Nakamura
      <a href="Group20.htm">
      Utaemon IV</a> that appeared soon after his death in 02/1852. The number
      of these published in Edo (Tokyo) was extraordinary, given that he had
      been acting in Osaka for the last two years of his life. His final role is
      depicted in this print.</font>
      <p><font size="2">Taira no Kiyomori
      (1118-81), who defeated the Minamoto (or Genji) clan in 1159 and presided
      over the subsequent rule of the Taira (or Heike) clan as a dictatorial
      Chancellor of the Empire. The story of the feud between the two families
      was told in the <i>Heike Monogatari</i> (Tale of the Heike), and became
      the subject of numerous plays.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">This print is in the medium-sized format called <i>chuban</i>
      ('medium sheet') as opposed to the full-sized <i>oban</i> ('full-sheet')
      format used for the rest of the prints in this exhibition. The <i>chuban</i>
      format was used extensively for actor prints in Osaka.</font></font>
