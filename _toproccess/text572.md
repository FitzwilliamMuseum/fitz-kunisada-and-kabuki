      <font size="2" face="Arial">Four prints from the
      series are displayed here, only two of which are known in other
      impressions. These were Kunisada's first <i>oban</i>
      (standard-format) half-length portraits for four years, with the exception
      of fan portraits. In each print in this series, the subtlety of the
      printing in relation to the design is evident in the use of diluted black
      ink for the calligraphic strokes that define the kimono and sash as well
      as the actor's name and role, the artist's signature, the censor's seal
      and the publisher's mark. As an added refinement, the poem in the actor's
      own hand is printed in colour set off by the delicate pink ground. This
      was the first time that a poem by the featured actor had been included on
      commercially issued actor-portraits. Such poems became a standard feature
      of Kunisada's half-length actor portraits, and are found on 110 of the 200
      portraits issued between 1820 and 1840 (although they are never
      encountered on commercially issued full-figure actor prints).<br>
      <br>
      The Saruwaka in the
      title of the play is Saruwaka Kanzaburo, who was given official
      permission by the Shogun to open the <a href="textA.htm">Saruwaka Theatre </a>(later
      renamed Nakamura when the family name changed), the first Kabuki theatre
      in Edo. The title thereby associates this performance with the Nakamura
      theatre. The 'gourd-crest' in the title belonged to the great warlord
      Hideyoshi, an indication that the play was one of the <i>Taikoki mono</i>
      (plays about the <i>taiko</i>), telling the story of the sixteenth-century
      warlord Hideyoshi, but with changed names. The identity of such historical
      characters was disguised to avoid infringing the ban on their portrayal on
      stage or in prints.</font>
