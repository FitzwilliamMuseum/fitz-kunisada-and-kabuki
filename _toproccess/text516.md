      <font face="Arial" size="2">Fragment of a much larger <a href="textP.htm"> surimono</a> made for
      the Go poetry group, with a text of poems praising the actor, and the
      image of a peony (one of the Ichikawa family symbols) designed by Totoya
      Hokkei (1780-1850). The complete print bears Kunisada�s seal reading <i>Kunisada
      aratame ni-sei Toyokuni no in </i>(�<a href="textC.htm">Seal of Kunisada changing to
      Toyokuni II�</a>), which records his adoption of his master Toyokuni�s
      name in New Year 1844. The print was probably designed in 1849, when his
      son <a href="Group12.htm"> Danjuro VIII</a> went to visit his father Ichikawa Ebizo V
      (formerly Danjuro VII) in exile in Osaka. Danjuro VII
      had been banished from Edo by the government (<i>bakufu</i>) in 1842 in
      punishment for his luxurious lifestyle as part of the Tempo reforms.
      The print shows Danjuro VII in one of his most famous roles,
      which was depicted many times in prints with the characteristic �lightning-in-the-clouds�
      pattern on Fuwa Banzaemon�s costume. The device of portraying an actor
      reflected in a mirror was used by Kunisada many times.</font>
