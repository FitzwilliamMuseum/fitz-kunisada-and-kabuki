        <p><font size="2">A spring <a href="textP.htm"> surimono</a> commissioned by two poets from
        Shigaraki in Goshu (Omi) Province. The women are seated
        in front of a six-panel Kano-school painted screen with a depiction of a
        pine tree, which was associated with Spring and the New Year. The
        shamisen was Japan's best-known stringed instrument and the major one
        accompanying Kabuki and puppet plays. It has three strings, a body
        covered with skin (initially snake but later dog or cat), and is played
        with an ivory or tortoise shell plectrum (<i>bachi</i>). The <i>koto</i>
        is a thirteen-stringed harp or zither-like instrument played with two
        hands. It was originally a court instrument but during the Edo period
        became a popular instrument for merchants' daughters to learn for
        parlour entertainment. Geisha were professional entertainers who would
        have been expert in playing these instruments for appearances at
        parties. The first poem, by Tsukinoya Tsuruhiko, suggests that a warbler
        in a cage sings to the accompaniment of a <i>koto</i> (possibly alluding
        to the popular comparison of courtesans in the licensed quarters to
        caged birds). The second poem, by Kachoya Noritsugu, speaks of a
        warbler singing its spring song amidst fragrant plum blossoms. The
        imagery in the poems is reflected on the designs of the <i>kimono</i>
        and <i>obi </i>(sash).</font></font>
