        III</a></font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
        <p>Kikugoro III (1784-1849) was one of the most talented actors of his
        age. He was adopted into the Onoe lineage of actors and made his debut
        at the age of four under the name Onoe Eisaburo I. After playing the
        parts of young men, he assumed the name of his adoptive father in 1809,
        becoming Onoe Matsusuke II. In 1814 he became Onoe Baiko, and a year
        later his reputation was such that he became the first actor for almost
        30 years to succeed to the Kikugoro name, becoming Onoe Kikugoro III
        (although he retained the name Baiko to sign his poetry). He became
        head of the company (<i>zagashira</i>) at Edo's Miyako theatre in 1817,
        after which his reputation grew for arrogance and feuding (particularly
        with his rival <a href="Group8pt1.htm"> Danjuro VII</a>). All too conscious of his own good looks,
        he was apparently narcissistic and difficult.</p>
        <p>He is perhaps best remembered for the frisson of his appearances with
        his rival <a href="Group4.htm"> Danjuro VII</a>, and for his alliance with the playwright
        Tsuruya Nanboku IV, who in 1825 wrote for him the role of Oiwa in <i>Tokaido
        yotsuya kaidan</i>, the best known of Kabuki ghost plays. Besides
        playing vengeful ghosts, Kikugoro's specialities included adolescent
        males (<i>wakashugata</i>) and older wise men (<i>jitsugoto</i>), but
        his range also extended to villains (<i>katakiyaku</i>) and female roles
        (<i>onnagata</i>). He was acclaimed as an all-round actor, or 'man of a
        thousand faces' (<i>kaneru ykusha</i>), and his ability for the
        miraculously quick changes (<i>hayagawari</i>) so popular in the Bunka-Bunsei
        eras (1804-30), allowed him to play seven to nine roles in one play.</p>
        <p>He made the first of several retirements in 1837, but returned to the
        stage in 1839. Before his 1847 retirement he appeared in <i>Onoe
        Kikugoro Ichidai Banashi</i>, a play that showcased his talent for
        ghost roles. He then opened a rice-cake shop, but was back on stage in
        1848, on tour to Nagoya and Osaka. He died on his way back to Edo.</p>
