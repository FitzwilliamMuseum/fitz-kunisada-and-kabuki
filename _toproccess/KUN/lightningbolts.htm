        revival (with a different name) of the play that brought
        Danjuro VII (now acting as Ebizo V) and Kikugoro III
        together in these highly successful roles. The well-known rivalry
        between the two actors added spice to their confrontation in this famous
        <a href="../Group4.htm">
        'Scabbards clashing' (<i>Saya-ate</i>) scene</a> in the third act, which had
        featured in prints associated with earlier productions. Fuwa Banzaemon
        carries a sword named 'Thunder' and wears a kimono decorated with a
        pattern of 'lightning-in-the-clouds'. His rival Nagoya Sanza carries a
        sword named 'Amorous Swallows' and wears a kimono with a
        'swallows-in-the-rain' pattern tied with a sash of knitted rope. Unaware
        of each other, they make simultaneous entrances boasting of their fame,
        along the two raised passageways (<i>hanamichi</i>) that run through the
        audience to the main stage. As they pass on the main stage, which
        represents Nakano Street in the Yoshiwara pleasure district at cherry
        blossom time, their sword hilts clash. They exchange insults, remove
        their green sedge travelling-hats, recognize one another and draw swords
        to fight over the courtesan Katsuragi, whom they both love.</font></p>
