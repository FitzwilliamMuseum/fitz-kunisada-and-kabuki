        as Yoshibei (left) in <i>Sumida haru geisha katagi</i> (The Character of
        a geisha in the Sumida Spring) performed at the Nakamura Theatre in
        03/1838<br>
        <br>
        </b>The actor Shikan II was adopted by Utaemon III in 1836 and
        subsequently took the name Utaemon IV. The white herons and black crows
        on the kimono�symbolising innocence and bad luck
        respectively�immediately identify the character of Yoshibei. After
        saving him from a robber on the banks of the O River, Yoshibei
        kills the unfortunate Chokichi in order to obtain the money he is
        carrying; in the process his little finger is bitten off. Yoshibei does
        not realise that he has killed the younger brother of his wife Koume.
        When Koume sees the missing finger in the corpse's mouth, she realises
        her husband is responsible. To bear the guilt herself she cuts off her
        own finger and kills herself. The impetuous Yoshibei and the gentle Chokichi
        are strongly contrasted in these prints. Each can stand by itself, but
        when they are paired they make a very effective diptych.</font></td>
