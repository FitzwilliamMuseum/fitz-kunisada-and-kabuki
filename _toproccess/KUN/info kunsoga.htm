        Confrontation of the Three Theatres�<i> </i>(<i>San shibai mitate
        taimen</i>), which shows the leading actors of the three competing Edo
        theatres as the cast for an imagined performance of the most popular of
        all Kabuki revenge tales. Soga no Juro is paired in this set
        with his mistress Oiso no Tora Gozen. The hero is shown wearing a
        monk�s robe and holding a monk�s hat. His kimono is decorated with
        the same flying-plovers pattern as his mistress�s. Tossho I
        (later called Gennosuke II) was noted for his skill in portraying
        refined young men. This portrait combines his elegant bearing with a
        sense of his grim determination to be revenged. The role of
        Juro�s mistress was in the popular category of steadfast
        courtesan. It allowed the female-role actor to display the breadth of
        his acting ability in lyric passages, scenes of amorous dalliance,
        gentle solicitude, grim determination and farce. Kikunojo V wears
        the full robes and luxurious hair ornaments of a courtesan. His pose is
        flirtatious, with the bundle of tissues representing an invitation to
        erotic dalliance. This was probably the last print of Kikunojo to
        be issued before his death in 01/1832 at the age of 30.</font><font FACE="Arial"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font><font FACE="Arial"></font></td>
