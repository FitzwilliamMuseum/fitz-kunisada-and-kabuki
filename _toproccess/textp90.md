      <font FACE="Arial"><font size="2">From an untitled series of large-head
      portraits (<i>okubi-e</i>) made in the last years of Kunisada's life and
      employing only the most expensive materials and the finest block-carvers
      and printers. It was recognised by his contemporaries as his masterpiece.
      It was the first set of <i>oban</i> (full-sheet) large heads since
      Utamaro's and Sharaku's series in the 1790s. By Kunisada's death 72 prints
      were completed, some of them designed by his assistant Utagawa Yoshitora
      (active <i>c.</i>1850-80). All of the actors in Kunisada's designs gave
      performances during his lifetime. Their various names are listed in the
      cartouche: here the actor's poetry name <i>Kako</i> is included. This is a
      posthumous portrait of Takenojo V (1812-51), who was known for his
      excessive lifestyle: during an illness in 1847 he made a pilgrimage to
      Narita with a party of forty, including hairdressers, chanters, and
      geisha, etc, taking ten days to return because of the constant partying.</font>
      <p><font size="2">Yasuna was the eponymous hero of a popular play
      premiered by <a href="Group16pt1.htm">Onoe Kikugoro III</a> and revived by
      <a href="Group18.htm">Danjuro IX.</a> He makes his entrance on the <i>hanamichi</i>
      (the raised passage-way leading from the back of the audience to the main
      stage) with loose hair, and wearing a <i>yamai hachimake</i> (illness
      headband). He is driven to madness by the suicide of his mistress, whose
      kimono he carries draped over his shoulder as he wanders through the
      countryside. He imagines that he sees her in the spring fields, but
      realising that he is alone he breaks down and weeps, clutching her
      garment.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The play was unusual among madness pieces (<i>kyoran
      mono</i>) in featuring a male instead of the usual female character.</font></font>
