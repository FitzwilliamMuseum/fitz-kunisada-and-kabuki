      <font FACE="Arial"><font size="2">From the set entitled 'Series Comparing
      the Diligence of Young Flowers' (<i>Hana-kurabe shussei-zukushi</i>),
      published 11/1861. Kunisada designed several prints in connection with
      this performance, three of which are included in this exhibition in this
      case.</font>
      <p><font size="2">This print depicts two of the triplets in the scene
      called <i>Kuruma Biki</i> (Pulling the Carriage Apart) in which they
      confront their triplet brother <a href="KUN/kunp85.htm">Matsuo-maru</a>
      who serves their enemy Shihei. They each wear a thick padded <i>dotera</i>
      kimono with a pattern of large purple and white squares (<i>soshigoshi</i>).
      They hold the green wicker hats (<i>amigasa</i>) that they have just
      removed, revealing their faces. Sakuramaru is the more elegant figure with
      subtle eye make-up known as <i>mukimi</i> ('trough-shell shadows') and
      divided forelock wig called <i>mae jasen</i> ('front-facing tea whisk');
      his more gentle role is traditionally played in a slightly effeminate
      manner (<i>wakashugata</i>). In contrast Umeo-maru is one of the prime
      examples of the <i>aragoto</i> ('rough-stuff') style of acting, with
      appropriately fierce red make-up with extra shadow lines (<i>nihon suji
      guma</i>), and extravagant wig with high pom-pom and spoke-like
      projections on either side, known as the <i>kuruma bin</i> (carriage
      sidelocks). For this scene he wore muscular body 'make-up', visible on his
      hands and arms, which was actually dyed onto white silk skin-garments.<i>
      Aragoto</i> roles were particularly associated with the Danjuro lineage of
      actors.</font></font>
