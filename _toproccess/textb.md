        <p>INSIDE A THEATRE</p>
        <p>This print published by Nishinomiya Shinroku shows the interior of
        the Nakamura Theatre in Sakai Street before the fire in 1841 that
        destroyed it and resulted in a move to Sarukawa Street.</p>
        <p>We are at the back of the theatre in the rear raised gallery (sajiki)
        looking towards the main stage at the far end.<a href="textE.htm"> Danjuro VII
        </a> as <a href="Group5.htm"> Sukeroku</a>
        (wearing the characteristic purple headband and carrying an umbrella),
        makes his entrance along the hon hanamichi (literally 'main flower
        path') on the left-hand side � a raised walkway that passes through
        the audience from the kirimaku curtain at the back to the main stage (a
        subsidiary or kari hanamichi is on the other side of the auditorium).
        The action is frozen on the main stage to focus attention on Danjuro.
        In front of him crouches a stage-hand (koken) holding a candle to
        illuminate the actor. Stage-hands usually wear discreet black clothing
        but for special performances more elaborate costume is worn: in this
        instance the costume is decorated on the back with <a href="textD.htm"> Danjuro's acting
        crest (mon), the triple-rice measure box (mimasu). </a> Other candles are
        lined up along the hanamichi and across the front of the stage, but the
        main light-source is daylight, coming through the high windows at the
        sides and also from the roof light. Music and sound effects emanate from
        the geza � a lattice-screened room on the right of the stage, while
        for some performances (those plays deriving from the puppet theatre)
        music comes from the chobo yuka � a lattice-screened booth above the
        stage-entrance on the right of the stage. The curtain of the main stage
        is pulled aside to the left. Above the stage is the tsurieda (hanging
        branches) � a border of artificial branches or flowers. The line of a
        circular revolve (mawari butai), added to the Nakamura Theatre in 1793,
        can be seen on the floorboards of the stage. From the ceiling of the
        auditorium hang lanterns bearing the actors' crests (<a href="textD.htm">mon</a>), with
        Danjuro's <a href="textD.htm"> mimasu</a> particularly prominent. His crest is seen again on
        the headscarf of one of his fans in the groundlings or doma ('earth
        space') at lower right.</p>
        <p>Vendors of snacks and tea make their way through the doma, which is
        divided by wooden railings into partitioned boxes or masu ('rice-measure
        box') each seating six or seven people. Those masu closer to the stage
        are more expensive, while the most expensive are those on the takadoma
        ('raised ground space'), a raised area round the edges of the hiradoma
        ('level ground space') introduced when the Nakamura was reconstructed in
        1802. More expensive still are the two-storey galleries (sajiki) raised
        up along the east (right) and west (left) sides. The best seats are
        those nearest the stage on the upper gallery (nikai sajiki); a ledge in
        front of this gallery accommodates food boxes. The lower gallery is
        called the 'quail' or uzura sajiki, because it resembles a birdcage.
        With the exception of the people peeping in through the roof light in
        this print, those with the cheapest view are in the two-storey rakan-dai
        ('Buddha's 500 disciples' enclosure) behind the stage at the left, from
        where they can see only the actors' backs (the enclosure got its name
        from the similarity to an array of Buddhist statues).</p>
        <p>Hanging either side of the main auditorium are announcements
        concerning the behaviour of the audience.</p>
