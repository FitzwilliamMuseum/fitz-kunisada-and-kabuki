        <b><font size="2" face="Arial">FEMALE-ROLE ACTORS (<i>onnagata</i>)
        COMPARED WITH BEAUTIFUL WOMEN (<i>bijin</i>)</font></b><font FACE="Arial">
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ban on women performers, first enforced in 1629 to
        discourage licentiousness, meant that female roles, frequently intended
        to represent the most beautiful courtesans, had to be taken by male
        actors. The juxtaposition of these two prints reveals much about the way
        in which Kunisada differentiated his <a href="textJ.htm"> portraits</a> of female-role male
        actors from those of beautiful women. The most immediate
        difference is the contrast between the angular lines that define the
        actor's face and the woman's fuller, softer features. In the actor
        portrait (left), the sharp hairline indicates that a full wig is being
        worn. In the other print, the woman's hairline is meticulously rendered
        to suggest real hair, and her eyelashes and eyebrows are also treated
        more elaborately; the representation of a woman is altogether more fluid
        and sensual. The coarser image of the actor is true to the reality it
        depicts. One can sense in it the 'strong line' that Kabuki fans so
        admired in the performance of female roles. Female-role actors were not
        exempt from the regulation that required all Japanese men to shave their
        forehead. Nor, initially, were they permitted to wear full wigs. They
        responded by covering their shaved foreheads with a small piece of
        purple silk. This <a href="KUN/kun251.htm"> purple patch</a> become so closely associated with the art
        of the female-role actor that it was retained even after full wigs were
        permitted. It can be seen in all the female-role actor portraits in this
        exhibition.</font></p>
