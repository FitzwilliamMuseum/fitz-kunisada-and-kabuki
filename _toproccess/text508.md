      <font FACE="Arial" size="2">This <a href="textP.htm"> surimono</a> shows a scene comes from the
      second half of a famous Kabuki dance drama first performed in 1784. It was
      set at the barrier gate at the pass on Mount Osaka sometime in the ninth
      century. Sekibei, posing as a guardian of the barrier, is none other than
      the villainous Omoto no Kuronushi, who secretly plans to overtake the
      country. He gets drunk and deduces from the stars reflected in his
      drinking bowl that he will overthrow the emperor if he performs a ritual
      using burnt wood from the nearby giant black cherry tree. But when he
      tries to chop it down, he is halted by the appearance of the spirit of the
      tree in the guise of the beautiful courtesan Somezome (her name means
      'dyed-black, like the tree). After a series of transformations Somezome is
      victorious. The poems both allude to the barrier gate (<i>seki no to</i>)
      in the title of the play; the second, by Shoeitei Tsukiyoshi, makes
      reference to the appearance of Onoe Kikugoro playing the spirit of
      the tree:<i><br>
      <br>
      The ice of the mountains has melted and&nbsp;<br>
 Onoe lingers like haze -<br>
      he blooms
      like flowers at the barrier gate.</i></font>
