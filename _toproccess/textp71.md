      <font FACE="Arial"><font size="2">A posthumous portrait of Onoe Baiju (a
      name used by <a href="Group16pt1.htm"> Onoe Kikugoro III</a> in retirement) as
      <a href="KUN/kunp72.htm"> Rokusaburo the carpenter</a>
      with a giant carp, from the series <i>Kiyogaki nanatsu iroha</i> (Neatly
      Written Syllabary in the Seven Styles). On the folding screen at the top
      the character for the syllable 'Ri' is written out in four different ways
      with different meanings, and also appears in a poem by Kizugawa Yoemon;
      one of the possible meanings is 'carp'.</font>
      <p><font size="2">Rokusaburo is the main character in the play <i>Mijikayo
      ukina no chirashigaki</i>, set in the timber yards of Fukugawa. The scene
      depicted is a 'carp-grappling scene' (<i>koitsukami</i>), which originated
      in the type of summer play (<i>natsu kyogen</i>) known as <i>mizu kyogen</i>
      ('water play'), using tanks of real water (<i>honmizu</i>) on stage. Plays
      with carp-grappling scenes (<i>koitsukami</i> <i>mono</i>) involved the
      hero in underwater combat with the spirit of a giant carp (an elaborate
      prop). The technique was passed down through the Onoe lineage of actors to
      <a href="Group16pt1.htm">Kikugoro III</a>, who made the scene famous in <i>Kijikayo
      ukina no chirashigaki </i>when it was premiered in 1813 and commemorated
      in an earlier print by Kunisada. In this print, the spray is achieved by
      splashing the surface with white pigment.</font></font>
