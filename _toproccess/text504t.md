      <font FACE="Arial"><font size="2">This <a href="textP.htm"> surimono</a> depicts Guan Yu, Liu Bei
      and Zhang Fei, who were known as Shoku sanketsu -<a href="Group15.htm"> the three heroes of the
      Chinese kingdom of Shu</a> (modern Szechuan Province) in the 4th century a.d.
      Their tale was best known through the Chinese novel Romance of the three
      kingdoms, which was introduced into Japan in the early Edo period and
      remains popular today. They were usually depicted in the famous scene when
      they exchanged oaths of brotherhood while drinking wine in a peach
      orchard. Their appearance on New Year surimono was usually combined with
      poems linking their attributes to conventional phrases and epithets for
      spring. One of the poems on this print likens the seasonal plum, cherry
      and peach to the 'three brothers'. The second poem makes reference to the
      incident in the legend of Ama no iwato when the cock crowed to lure the
      sun goddess Amaterasu out of the cave where she was hiding and thereby
      casting darkness over the world. The print was probably designed for
      spring in the year of the cock 1825.</font>
      <p><font size="2">The cherry orchard scene was so well-known that it was
      often parodied in prints.</font></font>
