      <font FACE="Arial"><font size="2">From the series <i>Imayo oshi-e kagami </i>(Up-to-date
      Padded Pictures in Mirrors). Kunisada designed several series of portraits
      of actors reflected in mirrors. Six prints from this series are included
      in this exhibition.</font>
      <p><font size="2">Sawamura Tanosuke III (1845-78) was one of the leading <i>onnagata</i>
      <a href="textG.htm">(female-role actors)</a> of his generation. When this
      print was made he had just become 'head <i>onnagata</i>'<i> </i>(<i>tate
      onnagata</i>) at the Morita theatre at the age of fifteen. His good looks
      and sex appeal assured him a large number of followers and his name became
      attached to numerous female hair and fashion accessories, including the
      Tanosuke <i>mage</i> (topknot), the Tanosuke<i> eri</i> (collar) and the
      Tanosuke<i> geta</i> (clog).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In 1865 he became ill with gangrene, and two years later
      his hand and foot were amputated. He continued acting for another four
      years, then retired and died at the age of 33 after going insane.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The printing here includes blind embossing (<i>karazuri</i>),
      textile embossing (<i>nunome-zuri</i>) in the background of the floral
      garment, burnishing (<i>tsuya-zuri</i>) on the black part of the mirror,
      and mica on the blue hair ornament. The seal of the block-carver Yokokawa
      Takejiro appears on the print.</font></font>
