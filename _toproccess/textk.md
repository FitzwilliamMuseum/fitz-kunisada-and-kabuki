        BLOCKS</font></b>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The blocks cut for actor prints were rarely re-used in
        the nineteenth century. This comparison of the exceptional re-use of
        blocks by the Edo publisher Sanoya Kihei shows unhappy but very
        instructive results.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1835 'Sugawara and the Secrets of Calligraphy' was
        performed at the Nakamura Theatre to great acclaim. Sanoya still had in
        his possession the blocks for a set of half-length portraits of the
        leading characters in this play that Kunisada had designed in 1831 when
        the play was performed at the Kawarazaki Theatre. Unfortunately for
        Sanoya, the roles were cast differently in 1835. Undeterred, he had the
        names and faces of the original actors cut from at least two of the old
        sets of blocks and replaced them with the names, poems and faces of the
        new performers. The name and poem were changed easily, though without
        much care for the overall balance. The insertion of the new face was
        more complex, and the plugging of the blocks all too obvious.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fewer blocks were used to print the re-issue, thus
        omitting inner patterns on the kimono. The blocks had not been well
        cared for, and a break is evident, at the top right point formed by the
        sleeve tossed behind the actor's head. The printing and colouring of the
        re-issue is insensitive. The subtle tones of the original have been
        replaced by flat colours, while the carefully-judged grey used for the
        keyblock and texts of the original has been replaced by a thick, uniform
        black which hardens and clutters the design. In the original such a
        black was confined to the actor's hair, pupils and blackened teeth
        (fashionable during the period of the 10th century in which the play was
        set).</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">The re-issue hardly represents Kunisada's original
        intention, nor does it meet the standards consumers had come to expect
        from Sanoya Kihei, who published many of Kunisada's finest designs from
        the late 1820s to 1850s. Perhaps pressure to publish quickly in order to
        cash in on a current hit drove him to allow such an inept re-issue.</font></p>
