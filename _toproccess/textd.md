        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The art of the Kabuki theatre was handed
        down to successive generations of actors to refine and develop, and the
        continuity of acting traditions was reflected in their use of the same
        stage names. Within a family of actors, the stage name indicated the
        rank and relative skill of the individual using it. In the course of his
        career an actor might progress from one stage name to another. Thus the
        name <b><a href="textE.htm">Ichikawa Danjuro VII</a></b> indicates the seventh actor
        of the <b>Ichikawa</b> family to bear the stage name <b>Danjuro</b>.
        In 1832, midway through his career, <b>Ichikawa Danjuro VII</b>
        passed that stage name on to his son (who performed as <b><a href="Group12.htm">Ichikawa
        Danjuro VIII</a></b><a href="Group12.htm">)</a> and himself assumed another stage name much
        revered in the <b>Ichikawa</b> family�<b>Ebizo</b>�to perform
        as <b>Ichikawa Ebizo V</b>. Each actor also had a 'shop name' (<i>yago</i>),
        which was a nickname shouted out by fans to encourage him during a
        performance. The shop name linked to the stage name <b>Danjuro</b>
        was <b>Naritaya</b>. Each actor also had a name with which he signed his
        poetry (<i>haigo</i>). The poetry names linked to the stage name
        Danjuro were <b>Sansho </b>and<b> Hakuen</b>.<br>
        Along with the family name (<i>sei</i>) the actor inherited a type of
        crest (<i>mon</i>) which, when it is seen on his costume, helps to
        identify him. For instance, the <b>Ichikawa</b> family crest was a
        triple rice-measure (<i>mimasu</i>)&nbsp;<br>
 � a
        square-within-a-square-within-a-square.
