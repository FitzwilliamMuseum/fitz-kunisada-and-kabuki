      <font face="Arial" size="2">Portrait of <a href="Group12.htm"> Ichikawa&nbsp;</a>
      <a href="textN.htm">Danjuro VIII</a> as Arajishi Otokonosuke with an inset portrait of Matsumoto Koshiro V as
      Nikki Danjo in <i>Date kurabe Okuni Kabuki</i> (A competition in
      ostentation: Okuni's Kabuki), from the series <i>Nazorae eto-awase</i>
      (Allusions to the Zodiac Signs).</font>
      <font FACE="Arial">
      <p><font size="2">This series matches the roles played by actors to signs
      of the zodiac. In
      this print the reference to the zodiac sign for the rat is evident to
      those with a knowledge of the <i>Yukashita</i> ('Under the floor of the
      Palace') scene of the play. The evil samurai Nikki Danjo (shown in the inset)
      transformed himself into a giant rat and in this guise he snatches a
      precious scroll and runs away with it in his mouth to hide beneath the
      palace floorboards. In the ensuing scene under the floor, the loyal
      samurai Arajishi Otokonosuke (the main figure in the print) uses his iron
      fan to strike the rat on the forehead. The rat is then transformed into
      his true self, disappearing through a trap door out of which Nikki is seen
      to rise, with the scroll still held in his mouth and a crescent-shaped
      wound from the blow on his forehead. He floats into the air and disappears
      into a cloud in the upper reaches of the theatre, with Otokonosuke
      posturing in <i>aragoto</i> ('rough-stuff') style on the main stage below.
      These stage postions are reflected in the design of this print.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">A print of the same scene was published four months
      earlier in a zodiac series designed by Kuniyoshi, illustrating the cast of
      a performance in 1851. Kunisada's print depicts an imaginary perfromance
      with a 'dream cast', in which the current star Danjuro VIII appears with
      Koshiro V, who had died in 1838, some fourteen years before this print was
      published. Koshiro was the most famous Nikki in history (his 1818
      performance opposite Danjuro VII in this scene was recorded in a diptych
      by Kunisada published in that year). Even today actors playing Nikki wear
      Koshiro's crest and costume pattern, and they use make-up to recreate <a href="KUN/kunp64.htm">the
      large spot that Koshiro had above his left eyebrow</a>.</font></font>
