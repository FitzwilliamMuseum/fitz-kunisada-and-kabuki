      <font FACE="Arial" size="2">A
      <a href="textP.htm">
      surimono</a> made for the song <i>Hana no cho</i> by Sono no Kocho,
      probably identifiable with the <i>kyoka</i> poet Ryuotei
      Edo no Hananari who commissioned other surimono with the <i>kocho</i>
      (buttterfly) seal found on this print (see also the <a href="KUN/kunp489.htm"> surimono entitled <i>Flower</i></a>).
      Kocho (butterfly) was the symbol and possibly also the name of the
      poetry club to which he belonged.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is one of many prints showing a geisha
      reading a love letter. The quality and design of the scroll shows that the
      woman's admirer was anxious to appear rich, and his letter boasts of being
      literate in both Japanese and Chinese. He assures her of his love,
      heedless of the misfortune predicted by fortune-tellers and the fear of
      becoming the talk of the town. Nothing, he concludes, can prevent the two
      of them, he the butterfly and she the flower, from coming together,
      despite the many hedges between them. The artist suggests her acquiescence
      by the butterflies on her pin and her kimono. The detail of the scroll is
      remarkable; and one character was amended after printing with a tiny piece
      of paper stuck over the top<br>
      Kunisada's <i>sada</i> seal here takes the form of the <i><a href="textD.htm">mimasu</a></i>
      (triple rice measure), which was the Ichikawa family of actors' crest (<i><a href="textD.htm">mon</a></i>).</font>
