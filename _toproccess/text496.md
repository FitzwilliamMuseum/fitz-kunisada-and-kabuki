      <a href="Group16pt3.htm"> Onoe
      Kikugoro III </a> being entertained on a rainy spring day at Umemoto, one of
      the three biggest teahouses in Naka-cho. Naka-cho was one of the seven
      entertainment quarters in the Fukagawa area, which were not officially
      approved by the government but which flourished in the first quarter of
      the 19th century. The entertainment given here was apparently more lively
      than in the Yoshiwara. The dandy and fashion-leader Kikugoro is portrayed
      in a kimono woven with his own chequer design called <i>Kikugoro-jima</i>.
      The black shape at top right is the end of a box containing a <i>shamisen</i>
      (3-stringed instrument)</font>
