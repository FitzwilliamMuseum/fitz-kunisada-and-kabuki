        Kumesaburo II</a></b><p>Kumesaburo (1799-1800) was the eldest son of Iwai
        Hanshiro V
        (formerly Kumesaburo I), who was the leading <a href="textG.htm">female
        role actor (onnagata)</a> of
        the previous generation. He made his debut with the name Iwai Kyujiro
        in 1804, performing with his father. He took the name Kumesaburo II in
        1812 and with <a href="Group7.htm"> Segawa Kikunojo V </a> was the leading actor of wakaonnagata
        (young female) roles. In 1822 he was chief female-role actor (tate
        onnagata) at the Nakamura theatre, while his father had the same
        position at the Ichimura theatre, and his younger brother Iwai Shijaku I
        at the Morita theatre.</p>
        <p>Like <a href="textE.htm"> other actors</a>, he was punished in 1827 for flouting sumptuary
        laws, and was put under house arrest. He was forced to leave Edo
        following the 1829 that destroyed the Edo theatres, but unlike the other
        Edo actors he could not go to Kamigata (Osaka and Kyoto) because of his
        frail constitution. In 1832 he succeeded to his father's name and became
        Hanshiro VI, ill health dogged him until his death in 1836. He was
        renowned for playing multiple roles.</p>
