        <p>Private collection</p>
        <p>From an untitled set containing at least eight designs, with poems
        across the top written out in the hand of the individual actor. The
        prints in the series relate to a variety of plays. These two prints
        depict characters from one of numerous plays that conflated the plots of
        two well-established plays (<i>Igagoe Norikake Gappa</i><b> </b>and <i>Igagoe
        docho sugoroku</i>) on the theme of the <a href="KUN/kunp77.htm"> Iga revenge (<i>Igagoe mono</i></a>).
        Along with <a href="Group6.htm"> Soga plays</a> and <i><a href="KUN/kun291.htm">Chushingura</a></i><a href="KUN/kun291.htm">,</a> this was the third of the
        three great revenge stories of Kabuki drama. The plot derived from the
        true story of a swordsman who took revenge on behalf of his
        brother-in-law by killing the murderer Matagoro at a crossroads in Iga
        Ueno in 1634. This play involves the efforts of Karaki Masaemon and his
        brother-in-law Wada Shizuma to catch up with the villainous Matagoro,
        who has murdered Shizuma's father Yukie. Osode the tea-shop girl is
        betrothed to Matagoro, whom she has never seen, but falls in love with
        Shizuma, who passes himself off as Matagoro. She helps him reach the
        house of her father, Yamada Kobei. It is not certain whether these two
        prints form a pair to show the characters in the same scene.</p>
        <p>All men in Japan at this time were required to shave the tops of
        their heads, so Matagoro's full head of hair indicates his outlaw
        status.</p>
