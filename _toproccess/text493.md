      <font FACE="Arial"><font size="2">This <a href="textP.htm"> surimono</a> is sealed beneath
      Kunisada�s signature with the artist�s <i>sada</i> seal in the form of
      the <i>mimasu</i> (triple-rice-measure) box which was the Ichikawa lineage
      acting crest <a href="textD.htm"> (<i>mon</i>).</a> It also bears the <a href="textP.htm"> production seal</a> of Kubo
      Shumman (1757-1820), indicating that Kunisada�s design was cut and
      printed by the Shumman studio. It was commissioned by the Go poetry group,
      whose stylised symbol made up of the character for �five� (<i>go</i>)
      is used as the pattern on the upper part of Danjuro IV�s outer
      robe.</font></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The surimono may have been intended as a
      memorial to Danjuro IV, and celebrates roles which were
      specialities of the Ichikawa lineage of actors. <i>Kagekiyo</i> was
      revived and revised by Danjuro IV and included by Danjuro
      VII in his selection of Eighteen Plays (<i>Kabuki Juhachiban</i>)
      specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage. The Ichikawa <i><a href="textD.htm">mimasu
      </a> </i><a href="textD.htm">crest
      (<i>mon</i>)</a> is seen on the hilt of Danjuro IV�s sword. He
      holds in a bag the precious <i>biwa </i>(lute) called Seizan, which
      Kagekiyo is hiding from his Genji enemies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Danjuro VII is shown in the
      foreground holding a fan in one hand, which is embossed with the silver
      triple stripe (<i>misuji</i>) associated with the Ichikawa lineage. In the
      other hand he holds a medicine packet bearing the character <i>uira[u]</i>,
      referring to the medicine <i>uiro</i>, which was supposed to cure
      everything from constipation to bad breath. The larger black case on his
      back has the characters for [O]dawara, the place where the medicine was
      produced. <i>Uiro</i> sellers were famous for their high-pitched
      voices and rapid sales-talk. Danjuro II, celebrated for his
      elocution, incorporated a <i>uiro</i> seller into a play on a <a href="Group6.htm"> Soga</a>
      theme in 1718 (<i>Wakamidori ikioi Soga</i>), in which he is actually Soga
      no Juro in disguise. Danjuro VII wears the costume
      associated with this role: decorated with lucky coins and with a lining
      motif of sacred <i>shimenawa</i> ropes and dangling paper streamers. He
      later incorporated the role into a performance of <i>Sukeroku yukari no
      Edo zakura</i> (Sukeroku�s affinity for the cherry blossoms of Edo), in
      which he passed the Danjuro name onto his ten-year-old son, who
      became <a href="Group12.htm"> Danjuro VIII.</a></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The poem on the surimono by Dokurakudo
      Takamori weaves into a standard New Year <i>kyoka</i> an allusion to
      the famed verbal gymnastics of the <i>uiro</i> seller, which in the
      play were supposedly due to the piece of <i>uiro</i> that he had put
      into his mouth:</font></p>
