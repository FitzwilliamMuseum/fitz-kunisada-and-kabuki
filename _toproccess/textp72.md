      Rokusaburo the carpenter</a>, made for the forthcoming performances of <i>Komamukae
      Tanomino Tsukkomi</i> (a version of <i>Mijikayo ukina no chirashigaki</i>)
      at the Morita theatre in 07/1858. Rokusaburo was the main character of the
      play, and appeared as the subject of <a href="textp71.htm"> numerous other
      prints</a>, especially in
      this 'carp-grappling scene' (<i>koitsukami</i>).</font>
      <p><font size="2">The actor depicted here was the centre of a celebrated
      incident in 1856 at the Morita theatre, when a samurai in the audience was
      so caught up in the action that he drew his sword and rushed onto the
      stage to attack Ichizo III. Several who rushed to help were killed, but
      Ichizo III only sustained a minor injury and resumed the play some days
      later, to great success.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The printing in this example includes fabric embossing (<i>nunome-zuri</i>)
      on the headband, burnishing (<i>tsuya-zuri</i>) on the black collar and
      fish-eye, and mica on the fish scales.</font></font>
