      <font face="Arial" size="2">In this <a href="textP.htm"> surimono</a> both actors wear the
      traditional wrestler�s dress of a folded <i>haori</i> jacket across the
      shoulders, and a second sash (<i>uwajime</i>) over the first to stop it
      unravelling. The play derived from the puppet theatre and appears to have
      been based on a true event in which a quarrelsome Sumo wrestler named
      Nuregami Chogoro killed a samurai and was captured after hiding
      out at his father�s house in Yawata village. In the play, Hanaregoma
      Chokichi is an amateur wrestler whose patron is at odds with
      Chogoro�s patron Yogoro. In this scene the two wrestlers
      engage in a test of strength to see who can crush a tea cup with their
      bare hand. Chogoro succeeds, but the amateur Chokichi&nbsp;has
      to cheat by hitting the cup against the guard of his sword (<i>katana no
      scuba</i>). The two later swear allegiance as blood brothers. The words <i>futatsu</i>
      (two) and<i> chocho</i> (butterflies) in the play�s title pun
      on the wrestlers� names, which both include the character <i>cho</i>
      (long).</font>
