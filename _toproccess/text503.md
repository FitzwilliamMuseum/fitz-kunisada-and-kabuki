      of the famous armour-pulling scene (<i>kusazuribiki</i>) which had become
      a highpoint of various Kabuki plays telling of the revenge of the two <a href="Group6.htm"> Soga
      brothers,</a> Soga no Juro and Soga no Goro, on their father�s
      murderer Kudo Suketsune. Soga no Goro, believing his brother to
      be in mortal danger, rushes out from hiding to his defence, only to be
      held back by the legendary strongman warrior Asaina no Saburo
      (1176-?) tugging at the skirt of his armour. Goro was said to have
      held his ground like a guardian statue. This print probably depicts an
      imaginary performance of a Soga brothers vendetta play, as these actors
      did not appear in these roles in 1827.</font></font>
      <p>Danjuro�s costume bears the Soga butterfly crest, while his
      sword-hilt is decorated with the Ichikawa acting crest (<i><a href="textD.htm">mon</a></i>) of
      three concentric boxes, or triple-rice-measure (<i><a href="textD.htm">mimasu</a></i>).
      Mitsugoro�s acting crest (<i>mon</i>)�a circle containing the
      triple-stroke character for �three��decorates his costume.</p>
      <font FACE="Arial">
      <p><font size="2">The first poem puns on the verb <i>hikeru</i>, which can
      refer either to �trailing� mists or �tugging�. The other poem
      likens the curling leaves of springtime bracken ferns to clenched fists.</font></font></font>
