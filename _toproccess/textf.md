        <p>I<font size="2">ssued in 1819, this pair of fan prints (<i>uchiwa-e</i>)
        depicts two of the most popular actors of the day in the lead roles of a
        new production of one of the best-loved plays in the Kabuki repertoire.
        Ichikawa Danjuro VII was renowned for his portrayal of the elegant and
        audacious young hero, Sukeroku, and in 1819 he was competing with Onoe
        Kikugoro III who was performing in a rival version, thus causing a rift
        between the two actors. Sukeroku, with his flouting of authority and
        stylish wit, summed up in his character all those traits that the Edo
        theatregoer most enjoyed. His costume was that of the Yoshiwara dandy: a
        robe with flaps that pulled back to show the red lining, and a headband
        in Edo purple (<i>Edo Murasaki</i>). The word for 'affinity' (<i>yukari</i>)
        in the play's title also meant 'purple' and alluded to this headband.
        The leading female-role actor Kikunojo V as Sukeroku's paramour,
        Agemaki, is dressed in all the finery of the Yoshiwara courtesan. This
        is an example of a play where the characters are understood to be
        historical figures in disguise. Sukeroku is actually Soga no Goro, who
        is seeking out a missing heirloom sword by provoking quarrels with
        visitors to the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters, thus forcing them to draw
        their swords.</font></p>

        particularly rare: they have been clumsily cut out, but were never
