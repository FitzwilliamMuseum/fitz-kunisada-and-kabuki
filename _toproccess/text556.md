      <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">This famous <i><a href="Group4.htm">Saya-ate</a></i><a href="Group4.htm">
        ('Scabbards clashing') confrontation scene</a> occurs in the third act
        of the play, which was written for these performers and first performed
        in this production in 1823. The idea derived both from the established
        Kabuki convention of a <i>Saya-ate</i> scene, and from the 1807 novel by
        Santo Kyoden, <i>Mukashi banashi inazuma hyoshi</i> (An
        Old Time Lightning Bolt Tale). Fuwa Banzaemon carries a sword named
        'Thunder' and wears a kimono decorated with a pattern of
        'lightning-in-the-clouds'. His rival Nagoya Sanzaburo (Sanza for
        short) carries a sword named 'Amorous Swallows' and wears a kimono
        decorated with a 'swallows-in-the-rain' pattern. Unaware of each other,
        they make simultaneous entrances along the two raised passageways (<i>hanamichi</i>)
        through the audience. As they pass on the main stage (which represents
        Nakano Street in the Yoshiwara pleasure district at cherry blossom
        time), their sword hilts clash. They exchange insults, remove their
        green sedge travelling-hats, recognize one another and draw swords to
        fight over the courtesan Katsuragi. Katsuragi rushes forward and
        persuades them to call a truce.</font>
