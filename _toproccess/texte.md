        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Danjuro VII (1791�1859) was
        the most popular of nineteenth-century Kabuki actors. He made his stage
        debut at the age of four and went on to astonish the public with his
        ability to handle every major type of role. He was particularly noted
        for his portrayal of audacious young heroes in the 'rough-stuff' (<i>aragoto</i>)
        acting style established by the <a href="textD.htm"> Ichikawa lineage.</a> 
        He became wealthy and constructed an ostentatious villa with extensive
        gardens in Edo (Tokyo). In the summer of 1842 he was arrested and found
        guilty of violating the sumptuary laws. His home was demolished and he
        was banished from Edo until 1850. Four years later his eldest son (<a href="Group12.htm">Danjuro VIII,</a>
        1823�1854) committed suicide. His father was devastated but continued
        to act until his death in 1859.<br>
        Kunisada was evidently particularly inspired by Danjuro VII.
        They were near contemporaries: Danjuro VII's first great stage
        success occurred in 1811, when Kunisada was establishing his reputation
        as a designer of actor prints. Over the next fifty years Kunisada
        depicted Danjuro VII more frequently than any other actor,
        both in commercially published prints and books, and in privately issued
        surimono, some of which document their acquaintance in private life.
        Kunisada's <i>sada</i>  seal, which he occasionally added beneath his
        signature, sometimes took the form of the<a href="textD.htm"> <i>mimasu</i> 
        </a> (triple rice-measure) that was the Danjuro's acting crest <a href="textD.htm"> (<i>mon</i></a>).</font></font>
