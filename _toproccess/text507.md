      showing the scene of Mongaku Shonin (1120-99) reciting prayers under
      the icy waterfall of Nachi in penance for accidentally killing his lover.
      He witnesses a manifestation of the Buddhist deity Fudo Myo-o
      (the guardian of waterfalls) who appears at the top with his two
      attendants (<i>doji</i>) Kongara and Seitaka. A number of plays were
      derived from this story, based on the Heike monogatari (Tales of the
      Heike) and <i>Gempei seisuiki</i> (Account of the Genpei wars), but this
      is evidently an 'imaginary grouping', rather than a record of an actual
      production, as Kunisada depicts Danjuro VII's deceased
      grandfather, Danjuro V, in the role of Fudo. The scene had
      a special significance for the Danjuro lineage of actors ever
      since their founder, Danjuro I (1660-1704), prayed successfully
      to the image of Fudo at the Shinshoji temple in Narita, and
      thereafter used Naritaya as his <i><a href="textD.htm">yago </a> </i><a href="textD.htm">('house name'),</a> the
      nickname shouted out by fans to encourage him during performance. Before
      assuming the Danjuro stage-name, actors performed the same
      religious purification (<i>misogi</i>) as Mongaku at the waterfall at
      Shinshoji, where it was believed that the spirit of Fudo came to
      inhabit them. A votive plaque painted by Kunisada at the temple also
      records this scene.</font>
      <p><font size="2">The poem by Umenoya plays irreverently by associating Fudo's
      coiled rope with the rope used to wrap wine casks as temple or shrine
      offerings, and by transforming the penitential waterfall (<i>taki</i>)
      into a famous brand of wine, <i>Takisui</i> (literally, 'water from a
      waterfall'), which was sold at the Yomo wine shop in Izumicho in the
      Kanda district of Edo.</font></font>
