      <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">This is a 'farewell' <a href="textP.htm"> surimono</a><i> </i>depicting
      the actor <a href="Group16pt3.htm"> Onoe Kikugoro III</a> before he departed on his pilgrimage to the
      Tenjin Shrine at Dazaifu on Kyushu in 10/1825. He is seated on the
      second-floor balcony of a Shinagawa restaurant at the start of the
      Tokaido highway. He had just completed performing in the sensational
      first performance of the most famous of Kabuki ghost plays, <i>Tokaido
      Yotsuya kaidan</i>, which had been written for him by Tsuruya Nanboku IV.
      Kikugoro achieved great fame for using a series of astonishing
      costume-changing devices in order to perform three central roles.
      <p>Kikugoro's acting crest (<i><a href="textD.htm">mon</a></i>) appears on the sleeves of his
      robe. The plum-blossom (<i>gyoyo-giku</i>) pattern was also a personal
      motif of Kikugoro, whose poetry name was Baiko ('Plum luck'). Plum was
      also associated with the Tenjin Shrine. The bat-motif on the waitress's
      kimono is a symbol of good luck. The turtle motif on the railing may be
      the mark of the <i>kyoka</i> poetry club that commissioned the print.</font>
