      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">A <a href="textP.htm"> surimono</a> diptych showing the famous
      �<a href="Group4.htm">Scabbards clashing� (<i>Saya-ate</i>)</a> scene in a revival (with a
      different name) of the play that first brought Danjuro VII and
      Kikugoro III together in these highly successful roles in 1823. This
      scene was subsequently performed as a separate dance-drama. Fuwa Banzaemon
      carries a sword named �Thunder� and wears a kimono decorated with a
      pattern of �lightning-in-the-clouds�. His rival Nagoya Sanza carries a
      sword named �Amorous Swallows� and wears a kimono with a �swallows-in-the-rain�
      pattern tied with a sash of knitted rope. Unaware of each other, they make
      simultaneous entrances boasting of their fame, along the two raised
      passageways (<i>hanamichi</i>) that run through the audience to the main
      stage. As they pass on the main stage, which represents Nakano Street in
      the Yoshiwara pleasure district at cherry blossom time, their sword hilts
      clash � a breach of etiquette demanding an apology. This depiction shows
      them at the moment when they raise their deep sedge traveling-hats and
      recognize each other, before drawing swords to fight over the courtesan
      Katsuragi, whom they both love.</font></p>
