      for the role. Two servants struggle to tighten his armour and jacket,
      while another servant on the right brings in the giant trousers (<i>hakama</i>).
      The great eight-foot sword that he will carry over his shoulder is seen
      resting against the wall behind him.</font><font FACE="Arial">
      <p><font size="2">This book appeared in four volumes and provided
      meticulously rendered views of actors on and off stage, with a text
      discussing leading actors and their predecessors. It is remarkable for its
      restrained yet rich palette. A book like this would cost considerably more
      than a single-sheet colour print. It was intended for the wealthier
      connoisseurs of the Kabuki theatre.</font></font>
