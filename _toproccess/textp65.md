      <p><font size="2">Inuyama Dosetsu was one of the 8 samurai in Takizawa
      Baikin's quasi-historical novel, <i>Nanso Satomi Hakkenden</i> (<a href="Group23.htm">Biography
      of the Eight Dogs</a>), issued over many years (1814-42) with
      illustrations by several artists including Kunisada. It tells the story of
      nine generations of the fictional Satomi clan. Each samurai represents a
      different samurai virtue, and has a name that includes the word for 'dog'
      (<i>inu</i>). The story was first adapted for Kabuki in 1834, and
      subsequent versions included Sakurada Jisuke III's <i>Satomi Hakkenden</i>,
      produced in 1852 when this print was issued. Earlier in that year,
      Kuniyoshi designed a print of Dosetsu in his 'Kiso Highway' series.</font></font>
