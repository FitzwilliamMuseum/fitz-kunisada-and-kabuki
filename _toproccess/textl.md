<b><font FACE="Arial"><font size="2">ROUND-MIRROR FORMAT PRINTS</font></font></b><font FACE="Arial">
<p><font size="2">Print artists occasionally designed compositions that showed a
beauty or an actor from behind with their face visible in a mirror. Sometimes
the face in the mirror was of a figure not otherwise visible in the print.
Artists also experimented with designs that consisted of no more than a mirror
with a face reflected in it. The latter format appealed to Kunisada, who used it
for the first time in the early 1820s for a distinguished set of beauties
reflected in round hand mirrors. In the late 1820s he applied the format to
actor portraiture for the first time to produce an untitled set of over forty
portraits, each reflected in a round mirror resting in a lacquer case. This was
his largest set of actor portraits before the late 1840s. In addition to the
leading actors of the day, he included many lesser performers in it. On each
print a poem from the actor�s brush is inscribed above the mirror.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Kunisada returned to the format in the late 1840s with a set
entitled �A Mirror of Past and Present Examples of Loyalty and Filial Piety�.
The continuing force of the restrictive regulations issued in 1842 was
responsible for the self-justifying title and for the absence of actors� names
on the prints in this set. Instead of actors� poems, the set title and the
heroic role in which each actor is depicted are emblazoned across the top of
each design.</font></p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kunisada employed the round-mirror format for
actor portraits for a third time in the late 1850s. The title of this set��Up-to-date
Padded Pictures in Mirrors� (<i>Imay&#333; oshi-e kagami</i>)�is given in a
tinted rectangular box, as is the role in which each actor is depicted. Although
the actors are not named, their poems are inscribed across the top of the print.
As an added embellishment, the ground is scattered with small squares of yellow
to suggest expensive gold-flecked paper.</font>
