      VII </a>is shown in his sumptuous residence, seated to the left and
      holding a folding fan on which he is about to inscribe a poem. Fans that
      he has already inscribed lie at his side. On the right the actor Araki
      Minsho applies Danjuro's personal seal to the inscribed
      fans. The manager of the Nakamura theatre, Nakamura Denkuro and an
      assistant manager, Naritaya Sobei, look on. The painting resting against
      the back wall is of the actor Matsumoto Koshiro V and carries
      Kunisada's signature. The opulence of the fittings and furnishings in Danjuro's
      villa contravened the sumptuary laws. Officials turned a blind eye to his
      lifestyle until 1842, when charges were brought against him, parts of his
      residence were razed to the ground, and he was exiled from Edo.</font>
