      the female role is taken by the well-known<a href="textG.htm"> <i>onnagata</i> 
      </a> Ichikawa
      Monnosuke III (1794-1824). The poem was written out by Monnosuke himself
      at the poet�s request (�just as I was asked by him�) and sealed with
      the actor�s poetry name <i>Shinsha III</i>. Another similarly signed and
      sealed surimono depicts the same actor in his dressing room. There was a
      particular <i>cach�</i> to having your poem written out by a famous
      actor. The design on Monnosuke�s costume in this print includes the <i>Go</i>
      symbol indicating that the poet Shiien Momomaro who commissioned the print
      belonged to the Go poetry group. Monnosuke wears a feathered cloak
      suggesting that his character is inhabited by the spirit of a fantastic
      bird. The child actor holds a candle or �face-lighter� (<i>tsura-akari</i>)
      which was held out on a long pole (<i>sashidashi</i>) to highlight actors�
      faces when they entered on the <i>hanamichi</i>, but also in supernatural
      scenes like this they were used to represent a spirit. <i>Kyoran mono</i>
      (Madness pieces) derived from a similar class of No plays, and often
      centred on a female character whose madness was induced by the grief of a
      lost child or unrequited love.</font><font FACE="Arial">
