      <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">In Act VII of this famous play about the revenge of the forty-seven
        samurai, the leader of the band, Yuranosuke, is found playing the
        profligate in a brothel in order to deceive his enemy's spies. In the
        scene depicted here, Heiemon, a foot soldier in the service of their
        deceased master, approaches Yuranosuke and asks to be allowed to join in
        his plot against the powerful courtier who was responsible for their
        master's downfall. Yuranosuke denies the existence of any such plot and
        claims he is under no obligation to avenge their master's disgrace and
        death. Heiemon remonstrates with him but Yuranosuke pretends to fall
        asleep. Their dialogue is inscribed on the print. Yuranosuke eventually
        led his fellow samurai against their common enemy and they succeeded in
        killing him. They all then committed suicide.</font>
