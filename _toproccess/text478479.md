      lovers meeting under a plum tree in a rain storm. Their anxiety suggests
      that it is probably one of the many love-suicide <i>michiyuki</i>
      (travel-going) scenes featured in plays about pairs of lovers such as
      Gonpachi and Komurasaki or Osome and Hisamatsu. Typically the couple in
      question despair at ever finding happiness in the world and decide to
      commit double-suicide, often by leaping into the river. Outdoor <i>michiyuki</i>
      (travel-going) scenes had become a staple part of Kabuki plays by the
      nineteenth century, and might involve a more hopeful sort of journey, such
      as lovers on their way to be married. Sometimes <i>michiyuki</i> were
      performed on their own.</font></font>
