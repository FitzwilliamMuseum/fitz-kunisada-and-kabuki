        From the series 'Fifty-three stations of the Tokaido Highway'
        (<i>Tokaido gojusan tsugi no uchi</i>) published by
        Yamamotoya Heikichi. The triptych depicts Bando Tamasaburo I
        as Izayoi (right), <a href="Group16pt1.htm"> Onoe Kikugoro III </a> as Usugumo Dayu (centre)
        and Ichimura Uzaemon XII as Inaba no suke (left) in <i>Ume no haru
        gojusan tsugi</i> (Fifty-three stations with plum blossoming in
        Spring) performed at the Ichimura theatre from 23/02/1835. The roles on
        the print do not directly correspond to those performed by the actors on
        stage, indicating that the print was published in advance of the
        performance, before the roles were fixed. The play took episodes
        associated with each of the staging-posts on the <a href="Group1.htm">Tokaido
        highway</a> between Edo (Tokyo) and Kyoto, and assembled them into an
        omnibus-like plot. Some of these involved apparitions. A legend told
        that the houses along the road at Okazaki were haunted by a giant cat.
        This triptych relates to the scene <i>Okazaki neko-ishi no kai</i> (The
        spirit of the Cat Rock at Okazaki), in which the giant cat-spirit
        appeared.<br>
        Plots involving cat-spirits belong to a category of play derived from
        the puppet theatre, called <i>Neko sodo mono</i> ('Cat-family
        dispute play'), which usually concerned people who wreaked havoc after
        being possessed by an evil cat-spirit. The first such Kabuki play was
        popularly known as <i>Okazaki no neko</i> (The Cat of Okazaki) because
        of the episode in which a mother was possessed by a cat-spirit and took
        up residence in an old temple at Okazaki, where she practised cat
        witchcraft. It was first produced in 1827, starring Onoe Kikugoro
        III, and was based on the picaresque novel by Jippensha Ikku, <i>Tokaidochu
        hiza kurige </i>(On Shanks's Mare along the Tokaido), which
        told the story of two comic characters from Edo making their way along
        the Tokaido.</font>
