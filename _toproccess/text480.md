      showing a scene from a play based on the subject of the Eternal Couple
      from the Legend of Takasago. Jo and Uba were supposed to have fallen
      in love when young, and after living to a very old age their spirits came
      to abide in pine trees, one on the beach at Takasago in Harima, and the
      other at Sumiyoshi in Sesshu near Osaka. Their spirits returned on
      moonlit nights in human form with rakes to continue their work of clearing
      the pine needles on Takasago Beach. The legend inspired the No play <i>Takasago,
      </i>and was subsequently taken up by Kabuki, especially in the celebratory
      <i>Takasago mono</i> (Takasago dances), a line of celebratory dances, such
      as <i>Takasago tanzen</i>, premiered in 1785. In this print the actors are
      holding No masks.</font><font FACE="Arial">
      <p><font size="2">The Eternal Couple were a popular subject in art. They
      are usually shown, Jo with a rake and Uba with a broom, sweeping pine
      needles, which symbolise longevity, an appropriate wish for surimono
      intended as New Year gifts.</font></p>
