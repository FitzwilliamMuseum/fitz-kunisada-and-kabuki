        <p><font size="2">This print was issued commercially in the autumn of
        1831. It is laden with visual and textual information for the viewer to
        process. The following notes indicate some of the ways in which this
        print would have been read when first offered for sale.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">Inscriptions and marks</font></p>
        <ul>
        </b>
        <li><font size="2">The largest characters inscribed at the top right of
          the print name the actor depicted:<a href="textE.htm"> Ichikawa Danjuro VII,</a> one
          of the great exponents of heroic roles and the most popular of all
          nineteenth-century actors.</font></li>
        </font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">To the right of his name in much smaller
          characters is the name of the role in which he is depicted: that of
          Matsuomaru, one of the heroes in the popular historical drama <i><a href="Group3.htm">Sugawara
          and the Secrets of Calligraphy.</a> </i>He performed the role in a revival
          of the drama that opened at the Kawarazaki Theatre in Edo in 09.1831.</font></li>
        <font FACE="Arial">
        <li><font size="2">The two lines of cursive script to the left of the
          actor�s name remind the viewer of two other heroic roles that
          Danjuro had performed that season: Hyogonosuke in <i>Yaguchi
          Ferry Crossing</i> and Kumagae Naozane in <i>Chronicle of the Battle
          of Ichinotani</i> in performances at the Kawarazaki Theatre in the
          fifth and seventh month of 1831 respectively.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The artist�s signature, <i>Kunisada ga </i>(drawn
          by Kunisada), appears on the left edge of the print, written in
          characters of modest size and followed by the red circular <i>toshidama
          </i>seal used by artists of the Utagawa school.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The signature is balanced on the right edge of the
          print by the censor�s seal and publisher�s mark, which are placed
          just below Danjuro�s name. The publisher Sanoya Kihei
          issued many of Kunisada�s actor prints in the late 1820s and the
          1830s.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Above Danjuro�s head there is a poem of
          his own composition printed from a block that reproduces his own
          cursive script. It is signed and sealed �the seventh generation <a href="textD.htm">
          Sansho</a>� (Sansho is the �<a href="textD.htm">poetry name</a>� used by bearers
          of the Danjuro stage name.) The poem with its dense word
          play and multiple levels of meaning would have teased and delighted
          Danjuro�s fans, many of whom would also have been amateur
          poets. Only a few of the puns and allusions can be hinted at here.</font></li>

            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The place, <i>Shimosa</i>, in the last
              line of the poem is the name of the province in which the first
              actor to bear the Danjuro name was born in the
              seventeenth century. His successors made pilgrimages to his
              birthplace there to honour his memory.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The phrase <i> Shimosa</i> guri (�Chestnuts
              from <i> Shimosa</i>�) asks the reader to compare the fuzzy-haired
              appearance of Danjuro as depicted here with a bristly
              chestnut from <i>Shimosa</i>.</font></li>
            <li><font size="2">There is also a verbal pun in <i> sando</i> (�third

              chestnut that bears fruit three times a year.</font></li>
            <li><font size="2"><i>Sando</i> (�third time�) appears in the phrase
              ��for a third time/with a changed appearance�. This refers
              to the three roles that Danjuro performed that season,
              all of which are named on the print.</font></li>

          Danjuro is shown in a scene in the fourth act of the play
          entitled �The Village Schoolroom� (<i>Terakoya).</i></font></li>
        <font FACE="Arial">
        <li><font size="2">Matsuomaru makes his entrance in this scene in a
          palanquin feigning illness. His unshaved forehead, unruly hair and
          purple headband tied on the left side of his head to bring relief from
          headache, all lend credence to his claim that he is ill and at the
          same time indicate to the viewer that he is in a state of extreme
          nervous tension.</font></li>
        </font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">On stage, the costume worn by
          Danjuro VII in this scene would have been decorated with the
          branches of a <a href="KUN/kunp85.htm"> snow-laden pine. </a> The snow-covered pine branches <i>(matsu)</i>
          were meant not only to recall the character�s name, <i>Matsuo</i>maru,
          but also�through their literary associations�to emphasise his
          tragic fate and heroic nature (his triplet brothers were named after
          the plum, <i>Umeo</i>maru, and cherry, <i>Sakura</i>maru). In this
          print, Kunisada chose to depart from stage convention and depict the
          hero in a heavy overcoat decorated with roused dragons, beasts
          associated with great strength and nobility. The dragons serve to
          amplify the force of Danjuro�s VII�s pose and reflect
          the dreadful conflict of emotions within his loyal heart.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
        <p>Although he is in the employ of the villain of the piece,
        Matsuomaru remains loyal to his true lord, Kan Shojo. The
        villain ordered the murder of Kan Shojo�s young son and
        heir, Kan Shusai. He commanded Matsuomaro to accompany the
        party of officers sent to capture and kill the boy because he was the
        only person in his retinue who could identify the boy with certainty.
        Matsuomaru contrived to have his own son killed in place of Kan
        Shusai. His son is murdered off stage; it takes all his will to
        retain his composure at the muffled sound of the deathblow. His son�s
        severed head is then brought on stage in a box and laid before him. He
        opens the box, gazes on his son�s head, and with complete self-control
        announces, �Ah, that he has beheaded Kan Shusai�.there can be
        no doubt, no question.� Kunisada has depicted Danjuro as
        Matsuomaru at this dreadful moment. We see the actor portraying
        Matsuomaru�s pain as he is caught between his personal, paternal
        feelings and the merciless demands made by the code of loyalty that
        bound him to his lord. His excruciating inner struggle is expressed by
        the way the actor clenches his fist, grits his teeth and crosses his
        eyes. The hero must, without hesitation, fulfil his obligations to his
        lord no matter what the personal cost. This grim scene is regarded as
        one of the weightiest in all Kabuki for male-role actors.</p>
