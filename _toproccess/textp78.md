      oshi-e kagami</a> </i>(Up-to-date
      Padded Pictures in Mirrors). Kunisada designed several series of portraits
      of actors reflected in mirrors. Six prints from this series are included
      in this exhibition.</font>
      <p><font size="2">This print commemorates the first performance of this <i>kizewamono</i>
      (raw domestic drama), written by Kawatake Mokuami. The main strand of the
      plot concerns three honourable thieves, each of whom is called Kichisa.
      They swear blood brotherhood and end up killing each other rather than
      give themselves up to the police. Ishikawa Kodanji IV took the part of the
      ex-priest Osho Kichisa.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">This is from a luxury edition on thick paper with
      special printing effects, including blind embossing (<i>karazuri</i>),
      textile embossing (<i>nunome-zuri</i>) on the neckerchief and burnishing (<i>tsuya-zuri</i>)
      on the black. The seal of the leading block-carver Yokokawa Takejiro
      appears on the print.</font></font>
