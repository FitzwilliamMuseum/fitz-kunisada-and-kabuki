      <font size="2" face="Arial">From the set of nine designs entitled <a href="KUN/kun479.htm">
      'Modern cloth-picture battledores � stage hits' (<i>Tosei oshi-e
      hagoita � atari kyogen no uchii</i>)</a>. The title refers to
      battledores that were often elaborately decorated, sometimes with images
      made out of pieces of cut coloured-cloth. The <a href="textF2.htm"> format</a> had been used
      previously for actor-prints, most recently by Kunisada's master Toyokuni.
      In this set Kunisada depicted the leading actors of the early 1820s in
      their greatest recent hits. Kumesaburo had appeared as Yaoya Oshichi
      in the play <i>Fujibumi medetaku Kashiku</i> (The Sealed-letter crest
      and the auspicious farewell of Kashiku) in 01/1816. He wears the <i>fujibumi
      </i>crest (an envelope within a circle) of Arashi Kiyosaburo II who
      was so successful in this role in the early 18th century that subsequent
      actors playing the part all wore the crest, which became identified as
      that of Oshichi.The role was a type of strong-willed Edo woman, and was
      based on an actual incident in 1681 when the real Oshichi fell in love
      with a young priest whom she met at his temple while seeking shelter from
      a large fire. Hoping to see him again, she set fire to her own home,
      causing a massive blaze that led to her execution for arson. In the play
      her lover is Kichisa, and she raises a fire alarm by beating a drum,
      knowing that the penalty for raising a false alarm is death by immolation.</font>
