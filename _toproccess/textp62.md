      <font FACE="Arial">A portrait of Ichikawa Saruzo as Hori no Rammaru, with
      a view of Morishita on the <a href="Group1.htm"> Tokaido</a> Highway in the background, from the
      <a href="KUN/kunp60.htm">
      series</a> <i>Tokaido gojusan tsugi no uchi</i> (Fifty-three stations of the
      Tokaido Highway). As with all the prints in this series (two of them shown
      here), the landscape in the background is heavily indebted to a print in
      Hiroshige's famous series of Tokaido views published 20 years earlier.
      According to the advertisements for the series, Kunisada was inspired by
      the late Onoe Kikugoro III (1784-1849) who, in the last year of his life,
      had walked the length of the Tokaido giving performances along the way.
      <p>The publication was so ambitious that four publishers collaborated:
      Izutsaya, Iseya, Tsugiokaya and Sumiyoshiya. Initially the plan was for
      the whole series to be cut by the block-carver Yokogawa Takejiro and
      printed by Oumiya Hisagoro, but the size of the project led to other
      craftsmen being brought in.</font>
