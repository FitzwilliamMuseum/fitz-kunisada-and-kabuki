      <font FACE="Arial"><font size="2">From the series <i>Imayo oshi-e kagami </i>(Up-to-date
      Padded Pictures in Mirrors). Kunisada designed several series of portraits
      of actors reflected in mirrors. Six prints from this series are included
      in this exhibition.</font>
      <p><font size="2">This actor appeared only briefly with the name Onoe
      Baiko and is not therefore counted among the official lineage of the Onoe
      family. He had been adopted by Onoe Kikugoro IV in 1859, but the
      relationship was soon severed and he returned to his original adoptive
      father, Jitsukawa Enzaburo I, in his native Osaka, assuming the name
      Jitsukawa Enjaku I in 1863.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">This play was one of several kabuki versions of the
      puppet play by Chikamatsu Monzaemon telling the story of how Chubei was
      compromised by his blind love for Umegawa, a prostitute at the brothel
      owned by Tsuchiya Jiemon, who is depicted in this print.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The printing includes burnishing (<i>tsyra-zuri</i>) on
      the black. The seal of the leading block-carver Yokokawa Takejiro appears
      on the print.</font></font>
