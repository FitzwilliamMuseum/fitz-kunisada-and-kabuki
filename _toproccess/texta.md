        <p>SARUWAKA STREET</p>
        </b>
        <p>A fire in 1841 destroyed the district around Sakai Street (</font><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Sakai-cho</font></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">)
        where the Nakamura and other theatres were situated. The government (<i>bakufu</i>)
        reformer Mizuno Tadakuni refused permission to rebuild as an attempt to
        abolish the theatres. Another <i>bakufu</i> official sympathetic to
        Kabuki persuaded Mizuno to agree to relocate all the theatres (together
        with the puppet theatres) to the area north-east of Asakusa Kannon
        temple and south of the Nihon Embankment. This new theatre district,
        which was already a centre of popular pleasure, consisted of a single
        main street, renamed Saruwaka Street (</font><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Saruwaka-cho</font></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
        or <i>Saruwaka-machi</i>) after Saruwaka Kanzaburo, who founded Edo
        kabuki in the Nakamura Theatre in 1624.</p>
        <p>Saruwaka Street was entered through a gate at the south end (seen in
        the distance in Hiroshige's view). The east side was filled with
        teahouses, which can be seen on the left of Hiroshige's view, with
        waitresses talking to guests. The puppet theatres were also located on
        this side. On the opposite side were the three main Kabuki theatres
        licensed by the government. They can be identified in Hiroshige's print
        by the boxed turret or <i>yagura</i> ('drum tower') above each of them
        serving as a symbol of government (<i>bakufu</i>) approval. They were
        arranged in order of seniority, with the Nakamura first (seen in the
        distance), then the Ichimura and finally the Morita (seen on the extreme
        right of the print). The Morita had only recently re-opened after a
        period of closure during which productions took place under the aegis of
        the Kawarazaki Theatre, which served the Morita as a substitute, or <i>hikae
        yagura</i> ('alternate drum tower').</p>
        <p>The theatres appear closed. When a run of performances was in swing,
        the front of the theatres were covered with banners and signs, and the
        street was packed with people. The print presumably represents the
        street as it appeared at full moon in the 8</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="1">th</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
