        <p>Danjuro VIII (1823-54) was the son of <a href="Group8pt1.htm"> Danjuro VII</a> and made his
        debut in the year of his birth in the <i>kaomise</i> ('face-showing')
        performance that opened the season at the Ichimura theatre. Two years
        later he became Ichikawa Ebizo, a name he kept until he was nine, when
        his father passed to him the Danjuro name, and <a href="textD.htm"> assumed the name Ebizo
        for himself.</a> He became a leader of company (<i>zagashira</i>) six years
        later in 1838.</p>
        <p>Like his father, Danjuro VIII excelled in the <i>aragoto</i>
        ('rough-stuff') roles for which the Ichikawa lineage was famous. But as
        well as audacious young heroes, he was also extremely successful in the
        various roles of young lover (<i>nimaime</i>). Together with his good
        looks, this made him especially popular with female fans. When he played
        <a href="Group5.htm">Sukeroku,</a> in which he had to immerse himself in a barrel of water, the
        water was subsequently sold at exorbitant cost to avid admirers. Even
        when he had to appear as Yosaburo with a scarred face, pastry shops
        sold beanpaste buns with cracked outer skins called 'Yosaburo buns,
        which were devoured by the actor's fans. Despite his success, or even
        because of it, he was plagued by personal problems, perhaps exacerbated
        by his early achievements and the jealousy this caused among older
        actors. In 1854, during a tour of performances in Osaka with his father,
        he was found in his inn with his wrists slashed. He was suffering from
        massive debts, caused by his lifestyle, which emulated the excesses of
        his father.</font></td>
