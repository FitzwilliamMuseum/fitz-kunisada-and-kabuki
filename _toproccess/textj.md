        LIKENESSES' (<i>nigao</i>)</b>
        <p>In the early Edo period the only distinguishing features of an
        actor's identity in a portrait-print were pose, costume, and the actor's
        family crest <a href="textD.htm"> (<i>mon</i>)</a>. Little attempt was made to capture his
        individual likeness until the 1760s, when Shunsho (1726-92) introduced
        the idea of 'true likenesses' (<i>nigao</i>), whereby an actor could be
        made recognisable from a few keenly observed features. These would then
        be repeated in other portraits of the same actor, including those by
        different artists.</p>
        <p>The method was well established by Kunisada's day, as shown by an
        instruction book written and illustrated by his master Toyokuni and
        issued in 1817 with the title 'Quick instruction in the drawing of actor
        likenesses' (<i>Yakusha nigao haya-geiko</i>); see photograph. Toyokuni
        laid out the order in which to draw the features of the face, starting
        with the nose�'the centre of the face'�and moving on to the mouth,
        eyes and eyebrows, and finally the outline of the face itself. He
        stressed that the conventions of Kabuki acting had to be understood when
        placing the pupils in the eyes and drawing the eyebrows, explaining that
        'the eyebrows are determined by the nature of the eyes. When an actor
        stares, worries or laughs, the eyebrows should be drawn according to the
        eyes'.</p>
        <p>The <a href="KUN/info%20twowoman.htm"> stylisation </a> of features that formed the basis of 'true
        likenesses' matched the powerful expressive language of facial
        expression at significant moments of a Kabuki play, when an actor
        expressed his emotional state with exaggerated facial gestures such as
        tight grimaces or crossed eyes. These moments of high drama were
        especially effective because for the rest of the play the actor's face
        was relatively expressionless, and they were heightened by make-up that
        emphasised precisely those elements that make up a 'true likeness' �
        the prominent nose, mouth and eyes. These were usually the moments
        captured in actor portraits.</p>
