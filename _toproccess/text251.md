      <font face="Arial" size="2">From a set of ten prints entitled <i>Hotarugari
      � Edokko soroi</i> (Firefly catching � a line-up of Edo folk),
      depicting actors in the roles of typical Edo characters dressed for a
      summer firefly hunt. This impression is from a limited deluxe printing. It
      is on thicker paper than usual and employs more subtle pigments than those
      encountered in standard commercially issued prints. The nuances of
      printing enhance the impact of the graceful design, with its lilting sense
      of arrested motion. Particularly effective is the wiping of colour blocks
      to allow one colour to shade gradually into another. The<a href="textG.htm">
      purple patch </a>covering Kikunojo V's shaved pate and his coarse
      features identified him as a man, yet in dress and deportment he
      represented the essence of femininity. The butterfly that decorates his
      fan is the identifying feature of the <a href="textD.htm">crest (<i>mon</i>)
      </a>of the Kikunojo lineage of actors.</font>
