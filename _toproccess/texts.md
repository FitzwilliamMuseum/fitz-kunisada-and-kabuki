        <p>Shikan II (1796-1852) became the disciple of his uncle, the dance
        master Fujima Kanjuro I, and began his career as Fujima Kamesaburo.
        After becoming Kanjuro's adopted son in 1807, he worked as a
        choreographer before entering the household of Nakamura Utaemon III in
        1811 and changing his name to Nakamura Fujitaro. While performing in
        Osaka in 1813 he changed his name again to Nakamura Tsurusuke, gaining
        experience at the local small theatre (<i>koshibai</i>). While playing
        in Kyoto in 1825 he finally assumed the name Shikan II, which he kept
        until 1836, when he was adopted by Utaemon III (who changed his name to
        Tamasuke) and acceded to the name Utaemon IV.</p>
        <p>Back in Edo from Kamigata in 1827, he was punished along with <a href="textQ.htm"> other
        actors</a> for flouting sumptuary laws, and was put under house arrest. He
        became a very popular actor. Unlike Utaemon III, he was big an imposing
        in stature, and he excelled in large-scale 'history' or 'period play' (<i>jidaimono</i>)
        roles such as Matsuomaru in <i><a href="Group3.htm">Sugawara denju tenarai kagami</a></i>
        <a href="Group3.htm">
        (Sugawara and the secrets of calligraphy)</a>. He was not so good at
        domestic play roles (<i>sewamono</i>), but although he specialised in
        male leads (<i>tachiyaku</i>) he occasionally played female roles (<i>onnagata</i>).</p>
        <p>His artistic secrets were handed down to <a href="Group18.htm"> Danjuro
        IX</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="Group21.htm">Shikan IV</a> was
