      <p><font FACE="Arial" size="2">A scene from an Iga revenge drama <a href="textosode.htm">(<i>Igagoe
      mono</i></a>) that conflated the plots of two established plays (<i>Igagoe
      Norikake Gappa</i><b> </b>and <i>Igagoe docho sugoroku</i>). The plot,
      based on a true story, involves the efforts of Wada Shizuma and his
      brother-in-law Karaki Masaemon, to pursue the villainous Matagoro, who has
      murdered Shizuma's father Yukie. Their pursuit takes them along the <a href="Group1.htm">Tokaido
      </a>Highway. In this act, Shizuma reaches the Fuji River barrier and with
      the help of Osode the tea-shop girl, heads towards Okazaki, with Masaemon
      close behind. Although Osode is betrothed to Matagoro (whom she has never
      seen), she falls in love with Shizuma, who passes himself off as Matagoro.
      They reach the house of her father, Yamada Kobei, whom Masaemon recognizes
      as his old fighting teacher. Not knowing that these men are his enemies,
      Kobei asks Masaemon to aid Matagoro (his daughter's betrothed). Masaemon
      pretends to agree. His distraught wife Otani, whom he has divorced in
      order to gain his master's permission to let him help Shizuma, arrives
      outside the house, and collapses in the snow. Not wanting distractions,
      Masaemon grabs the infant that she is carrying and dispatches Otani to a
      nearby shrine. Back at the house, the men find a note inside the child's
      amulet identifying him as Masaemon's son. To show his loyalty, Masaemon
      kills the child and asks Kobei where Matagoro's is hiding. But Kobei has
      already divined the men's identities. Realising that they are in his debt
      he knows that honour demands that he must break his bond with Matagoro so
      that their vendetta can be played out.</font>
