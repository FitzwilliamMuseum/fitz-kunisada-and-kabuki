The blocks cut for actor prints were rarely re-used in the nineteenth century.
This comparison of the exceptional re-use of blocks by the Edo publisher Sanoya Kihei
shows unhappy but very instructive results.

In 1835 'Sugawara and the Secrets of Calligraphy' was performed at the Nakamura
Theatre to great acclaim. Sanoya still had in his possession the blocks for a set
of half-length portraits of the leading characters in this play that Kunisada had
designed in 1831 when the play was performed at the Kawarazaki Theatre. Unfortunately
for Sanoya, the roles were cast differently in 1835. Undeterred, he had the names and
faces of the original actors cut from at least two of the old sets of blocks and
replaced them with the names, poems and faces of the new performers. The name and
poem were changed easily, though without much care for the overall balance. The
insertion of the new face was more complex, and the plugging of the blocks all
too obvious.

Fewer blocks were used to print the re-issue, thus omitting inner patterns on the
kimono. The blocks had not been well cared for, and a break is evident, at the top
right point formed by the sleeve tossed behind the actor's head. The printing and
colouring of the re-issue is insensitive. The subtle tones of the original have
been replaced by flat colours, while the carefully-judged grey used for the keyblock
and texts of the original has been replaced by a thick, uniform black which hardens
and clutters the design. In the original such a black was confined to the actor's hair,
pupils and blackened teeth (fashionable during the period of the 10th century in
which the play was set).

The re-issue hardly represents Kunisada's original intention, nor does it meet
the standards consumers had come to expect from Sanoya Kihei, who published many
of Kunisada's finest designs from the late 1820s to 1850s. Perhaps pressure to
publish quickly in order to cash in on a current hit drove him to allow such an
inept re-issue.
