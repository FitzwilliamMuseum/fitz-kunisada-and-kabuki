Kunisada, like all of his contemporaries, designed a large number of fan prints. The greater portion of these portrayed actors. Printed fans were popular and inexpensive fashion accessories. As a result few have survived the wear and tear of ordinary use and today fans are the rarest of all categories of 19th-century prints.

Fan prints were either in the folding fan (_ogi_) or in the oval fan (_uchiwa_) format. All of Kunisada's known fan prints are in the oval format, although he occasionally used the folding fan format as a framing device in standard actor prints. Kunisada responded to the challenge of the fan's shape (and to other irregular shapes such as the battledore) with ingenious designs that make a virtue of the potentially awkward format.
