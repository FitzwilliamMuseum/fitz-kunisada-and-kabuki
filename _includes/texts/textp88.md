From the series _[Tosei mitate sanju-rokkasen](KUN/kunp89.htm)_ (Comparison of roles with the thirty-six flowers at their zenith).

The character of Rokusuke was a master fencer in a play that dramatised a revenge enacted in 1586. He lived in a village deep in the mountains of Kyushu. He is seeking revenge for the death of his old fencing master Ichimisai at the hands of Takumi. He wears formal dress and carries a branch of plum blossoms with both white and red petals to symbolise Ichimisai's daughters, and a branch of camelia to symbolise his widow Oko. Hence the comparison between the role of Rokusuke and the camellia in the title of this print.  

The printing includes blind embossing (_karazuri_), textile-embossing (_nunome-zuri_) and burnishing (_tsuya-zuri_) on black collar.
