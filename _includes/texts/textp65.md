[![Unuma, Inuyama no shiro embo � Dosetsu (Unuma, Distant view of Inuyama Castle: Dosetsu)](P.65-1999_small.jpg)](KUN/kunp65.htm)

Portrait of Sawamura Sojuro V (formerly Suketakaya Takasuke III) as Inuyuma Dosetsu, with a view of Inuyama Castle on the [Kiso Highway](Group22.htm) in the background, from the series _Kiso rokuju-kyu tsugi_ (Sixty-nine Kiso Stations).

This was one of several series by Kunisada with landscape backgrounds designed to capitalise on the success of the series of prints with views of the [Tokaido](Group1.htm) published in early 1852. Three prints from the _Kiso_ series are displayed here.

Inuyama Dosetsu was one of the 8 samurai in Takizawa Baikin's quasi-historical novel, _Nanso Satomi Hakkenden_ ([Biography of the Eight Dogs](Group23.htm)), issued over many years (1814-42) with illustrations by several artists including Kunisada. It tells the story of nine generations of the fictional Satomi clan. Each samurai represents a different samurai virtue, and has a name that includes the word for 'dog' (_inu_). The story was first adapted for Kabuki in 1834, and subsequent versions included Sakurada Jisuke III's _Satomi Hakkenden_, produced in 1852 when this print was issued. Earlier in that year, Kuniyoshi designed a print of Dosetsu in his 'Kiso Highway' series.
