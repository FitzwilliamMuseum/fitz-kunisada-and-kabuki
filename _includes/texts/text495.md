**Iwai Kumesaburo II in the role of a _shirabyoshi_ dancer**

c. 1830-2    
Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

In this [surimono](/theme/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) the actor wears a long-sleeved kimono (_furisode_) patterned with flowers and wasps and bearing the actor's crest (_mon_). The pink court robe has a stylised, linked iris pattern in silver, which was also associated with Kumesaburo. The poet Ryuotei Edo no Hananari who commissioned this print also commissioned [another surimono](KUN/kunp490.htm) from Kunisada of this actor. A number of Kabuki plays involved _shirabyoshi_ (white rhythm) dances, which were performed to a rhythmic accompaniment with changes of costume, bun-shaped hats and fans. The most notable characters who performed _shirabyoshi_ dances were Hanako in the dance-drama _Musume dojoji_, and Shizuka Gozen, mistress of Yoshitsune, in numerous plays.
