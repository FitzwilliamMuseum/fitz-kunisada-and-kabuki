Portrait of Arashi Kishisaburo III as Aboshi Samojiro, with a view of Itabashi on the [Kiso Highway](Group22.htm) in the background, from the series _Kiso rokuju-kyu tsugi_ (Sixty-nine Kiso Stations). This was one of several series by Kunisada with landscape backgrounds designed to capitalise on the success of the series of prints with views of the [Tokaido](/exhibition/group-1) published in early 1852. Three prints from the _Kiso_ series are displayed here.
