**Nakamura Shujaku (Tsuruzo I) as Kajiwara Heiza Kagetoki**

02/1860

Given by the Friends of the Fitzwilliam with the aid of the MGC Purchase Grant Fund and the National Art Collections Fund.

From the series _[Imayo oshi-e kagami](/exhibition/group-11)_ (Up-to-date Padded Pictures in Mirrors). Kunisada designed several series of portraits of actors reflected in mirrors. Six prints from this series are included in this exhibition.

Kajiwara Kagetoki was a 12th-century warrior who deserted the Heike clan to join the Genji. Often depicted as a villain, he was the hero of the play premiered in 1730 as _Miura no Osuke kobai tazuna_, the third act of which is still performed today and tells how Kagetoki proves the power of a Genji heirloom sword.

In contrast to the [other prints](KUN/kunp78.htm) included in this exhibition, this example is not from a luxury edition; it is printed with cheaper colours on thinner paper, without special additional printing effects such as embossing and burnishing. No block-carver's seal appears on the print.
