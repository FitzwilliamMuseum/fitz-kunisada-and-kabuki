**[Iwai Kumesaburo II](/exhibition/group-19) as Yaoya Oshichi**

Private collection

From the set of nine designs entitled ['Modern cloth-picture battledores  stage hits' (_Tosei oshi-e hagoita  atari kyogen no uchii_)](KUN/kun479.htm). The title refers to battledores that were often elaborately decorated, sometimes with images made out of pieces of cut coloured-cloth. The [format](/theme/fan-prints-one2) had been used previously for actor-prints, most recently by Kunisada's master Toyokuni. In this set Kunisada depicted the leading actors of the early 1820s in their greatest recent hits. Kumesaburo had appeared as Yaoya Oshichi in the play _Fujibumi medetaku Kashiku_ (The Sealed-letter crest and the auspicious farewell of Kashiku) in 01/1816.

He wears the _fujibumi_ crest (an envelope within a circle) of Arashi Kiyosaburo II who was so successful in this role in the early 18th century that subsequent actors playing the part all wore the crest, which became identified as that of Oshichi.The role was a type of strong-willed Edo woman, and was based on an actual incident in 1681 when the real Oshichi fell in love with a young priest whom she met at his temple while seeking shelter from a large fire. Hoping to see him again, she set fire to her own home, causing a massive blaze that led to her execution for arson. In the play her lover is Kichisa, and she raises a fire alarm by beating a drum, knowing that the penalty for raising a false alarm is death by immolation.
