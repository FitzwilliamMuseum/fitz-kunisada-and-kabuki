This [surimono](/context/textP) shows the Kabuki actor [Onoe Kikugoro III](/exhibition/group-16-part-3) being entertained on a rainy spring day at Umemoto, one of the three biggest teahouses in Naka-cho. Naka-cho was one of the seven entertainment quarters in the Fukagawa area, which were not officially approved by the government but which flourished in the first quarter of the 19th century.

The entertainment given here was apparently more lively than in the Yoshiwara. The dandy and fashion-leader Kikugoro is portrayed in a kimono woven with his own chequer design called _Kikugoro-jima_. The black shape at top right is the end of a box containing a _shamisen_ (3-stringed instrument)
