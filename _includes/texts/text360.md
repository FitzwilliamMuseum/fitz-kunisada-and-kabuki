Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

This [surimono](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) depicts women of a _samurai_ (feudal lord) household in the New Year custom of _Komatsu-biki_ (Picking pine saplings for the New Year festival), or _Ne no hi asobi_ (Outing on First Rat Day of New Year). The title refers to the three houses that a feudal lord was required by feudal law to keep in Edo (a mansion in the city for himself and his regional estate business; a mansion for the permanent residence of his family; and a suburban retreat in case of one of the fires that frequently swept the tinderbox city). The three poems, which are _haiku_ rather than _kyoka_, are written by a poet, Baigetsukan Senrei, who may himself have been a high-ranking person or feudal lord.
