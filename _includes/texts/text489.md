**Flower**

c. 1823-5  

Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

This is the 'Flower' print from a series of [surimono](/theme/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) titled _Kacho-fugetsu_ (Flower and bird, wind and moon). The [butterfly](text494.htm) is the seal of the _kyoka_ circle associated with the poet Ryuotei Edo no Hananari, who commissioned the print (the print was also issued without the seal). The woman imagines that she sees the face of her lover, whom she is longing to meet, appear in her mirror. She is holding a folded _yukata_ and may be about to go to the bath-house. The 'Wind' print from the series shows a courtesan awaiting her patron.The poem by Ryuotei Edo no Hananari reads:

> _By a subtle fragrance of flowers, my heart is so distracted and scattered,Â   
like dishevelled hair it is impossible to fix - the dawn in spring is so enchanting and impossible to describe._
