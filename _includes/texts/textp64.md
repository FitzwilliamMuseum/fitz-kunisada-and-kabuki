[![Takamiya Taga Taisha � Sasaki Genta Zaemon (Takamiya, Taga Great Shrine: Sasaki Genta Zaemon)](P.64-1999_small.jpg)](KUN/kunp64.htm)

Portrait of Matsumoto Koshiro V as Sasaki Genta Zaemon, with a view of Taga Great Shrine on the [Kiso Highway](Group22.htm) in the background, from the series _Kiso rokuju-kyu tsugi_ (Sixty-nine Kiso Stations).

This was one of several series by Kunisada with landscape backgrounds designed to capitalise on the success of the series of prints with views of the [Tokaido](Group1.htm) published in early 1852. Three prints from the _Kiso_ series are displayed here.

The actor Koshiro V (1764-1838) is recognisable by his hooked nose and by the large spot above his left eyebrow. He dominated the field of villain roles.
