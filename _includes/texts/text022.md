This print comes from Kunisada's first set of half-length beauties. Despite its title (which refers to the thirty-two marks of the Buddha) the set consists of only ten designs, each illustrating a woman of different character. Kunisada was influenced by Utamaro's prints made in the Kyowa era (1801ï¿½4) that probed the relationship of female character and physiognomy, particularly the set _Bijin go-menso_ (Five physiognomies of beauties), which also uses a magnifying-glass as a cartouche.
