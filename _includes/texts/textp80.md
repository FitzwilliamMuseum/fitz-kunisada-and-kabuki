[![Onoe Baiko (Jitsukawa Enjaku I) as Tsuchiya Jiemon in Koi-bikyaku Yamato orai, performed at the Nakamura theatre from 09/03/1860](P.80-1999_small1.jpg)](KUN/kunp80.htm)

From the series _Imayo oshi-e kagami_ (Up-to-date Padded Pictures in Mirrors). Kunisada designed several series of portraits of actors reflected in mirrors. Six prints from this series are included in this exhibition.

This actor appeared only briefly with the name Onoe Baiko and is not therefore counted among the official lineage of the Onoe family. He had been adopted by Onoe Kikugoro IV in 1859, but the relationship was soon severed and he returned to his original adoptive father, Jitsukawa Enzaburo I, in his native Osaka, assuming the name Jitsukawa Enjaku I in 1863.

This play was one of several kabuki versions of the puppet play by Chikamatsu Monzaemon telling the story of how Chubei was compromised by his blind love for Umegawa, a prostitute at the brothel owned by Tsuchiya Jiemon, who is depicted in this print.

The printing includes burnishing (_tsyra-zuri_) on the black. The seal of the leading block-carver Yokokawa Takejiro appears on the print.
