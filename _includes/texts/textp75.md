Given by the Friends of the Fitzwilliam with the aid of the MGC Purchase Grant Fund and the National Art Collections Fund.

A portrait of Katoaka Nizaemon VIII as [Karigane Bunshichi](KUN/kun320.htm), from the series 'Five Chivalrous Men and Women' (_Gonin danjo no uchi_), juxtaposed with an inset portrait of Ichikawa Dannosuke V as Magebo no Ocho.

Karigane Bunshichi was the leader of the 'Five Chivalrous Men', a gang of outlaws who were executed in 1702. The exploits of the gang provided the basis for many puppet and (later) Kabuki plays. Eventually the characters ceased to be villains; they were transformed into feisty _otokodate_ heroic commoners who stood up to wicked _samurai._ Kunisada had previously made [a print of Sawamura Tossho I as Karigane Bunshichi](KUN/kun320.htm) in an earlier series entitled _Tosei gonin otoko_ (A Modern 'Five chivalrous men') published in 1833 (included in the first part of this exhibition). The novelty of this later series was juxtaposing five women to match the five chivalrous men.

The printing includes blind embossing (_karazuri_), burnishing (_tsuya-zuri_) on the black collar and black kimono, and fabric embossing (_nunome-zuri_) on the white cloth over Karigane's shoulder.
