In this [surimono,](/context/textP) the female role is taken by the well-known [_onnagata_](/context/textG) Ichikawa Monnosuke III (1794-1824). The poem was written out by Monnosuke himself at the poet's request ('just as I was asked by him') and sealed with the actor's poetry name _Shinsha III_. Another similarly signed and sealed surimono depicts the same actor in his dressing room. There was a particular _cach'_ to having your poem written out by a famous actor. The design on Monnosuke's costume in this print includes the _Go_ symbol indicating that the poet Shiien Momomaro who commissioned the print belonged to the Go poetry group. Monnosuke wears a feathered cloak suggesting that his character is inhabited by the spirit of a fantastic bird. The child actor holds a candle or 'face-lighter' (_tsura-akari_) which was held out on a long pole (_sashidashi_) to highlight actors' faces when they entered on the _hanamichi_, but also in supernatural scenes like this they were used to represent a spirit. _Kyoran mono_ (Madness pieces) derived from a similar class of No plays, and often centred on a female character whose madness was induced by the grief of a lost child or unrequited love.

The producer's seal of [Suriko Kozen](/context/textP) appears on the print.
