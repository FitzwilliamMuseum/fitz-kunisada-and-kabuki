This [surimono](/context/textP) shows a scene comes from the second half of a famous Kabuki dance drama first performed in 1784. It was set at the barrier gate at the pass on Mount Osaka sometime in the ninth century. Sekibei, posing as a guardian of the barrier, is none other than the villainous Omoto no Kuronushi, who secretly plans to overtake the country. He gets drunk and deduces from the stars reflected in his drinking bowl that he will overthrow the emperor if he performs a ritual using burnt wood from the nearby giant black cherry tree. But when he tries to chop it down, he is halted by the appearance of the spirit of the tree in the guise of the beautiful courtesan Somezome (her name means 'dyed-black, like the tree). After a series of transformations Somezome is victorious. The poems both allude to the barrier gate (_seki no to_) in the title of the play; the second, by Shoeitei Tsukiyoshi, makes reference to the appearance of Onoe Kikugoro playing the spirit of the tree:_  

> The ice of the mountains has melted andÂ   
Onoe lingers like haze -  
he blooms like flowers at the barrier gate._
