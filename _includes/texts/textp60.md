A portrait of [Ichikawa](/exhibition/group-12)Â  [Danjuro VIII](/theme/ichikawa-danjuro-VIII) as [Kagekiyo,](/exhibition/group-14) with a view of Miya on the [Tokaido Highway](/exhibition/group-1) in the background, from the [series](KUN/kunp62.htm) _Tokaido gojusan tsugi no uchi_ (Fifty-three stations of the Tokaido Highway).


Akushichibyoe Kagekiyo, a leading Heike warrior in the Gempei wars, featured only briefly in the historical chronicle _Heike Monogatari_ (Tale of the Heike) but assumed great prominence in legend and in numerous kabuki and puppet dramas known as _Kagekiyo mono_ (Kagekiyo plays). One version was included by Danjuro VII in his selection of Eighteen Plays (_Kabuki Juhachiban_) specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage. The role called for the Ichikawa speciality of _aragoto_ ('rough-stuff') acting, with a _dotera_ (padded-dressing-gown) costume, huge bushy wig and red make-up (_beni suji_) with _suji gama_ ('line shadows') and painted blue beard (_han guma_).

As with all the prints in this series (two of them included here), the landscape in the background is heavily indebted to a print in Hiroshige's famous series of Tokaido views published 20 years earlier.
