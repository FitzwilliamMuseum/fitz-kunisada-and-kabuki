Vendors of snacks and tea make their way through the groundlings or _doma_ (earth space)_,_ which is divided by wooden railings into partitioned boxes or _masu_ (rice-measure box) each seating six or seven people.

The most expensive seats in the groundlings or _doma_ (earth space) are those on the _takadoma_ (raised ground space), a raised area round the edges of the _hiradoma_ (level ground space) introduced when the Nakamura was reconstructed in 1802.

More expensive seats than those in the _hiradoma_ are the two-storey galleries (_sajiki_) raised up along the east (right) and west (left) sides. The best seats are those nearest the stage on the upper gallery (_nikai sajiki_); a ledge in front of this gallery accommodates food boxes. The lower gallery is called the quail or _uzura sajiki_, because it resembles a birdcage.

The cheapest seats were in the two-storey _rakan-dai_ (Buddhas 500 disciples enclosure) behind the stage at the left, from where they can see only the actors backs (the enclosure got its name from the similarity to an array of Buddhist statues).

Hanging either side of the main auditorium are announcements concerning the behaviour of the audienceÂ
