**Ichikawa Ebizo V (formerly Danjuro VII) as Fuwa Banzaemon seen in a mirror**
c. 1849

Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

Fragment of a much larger [surimono](/context/textP) made for the Go poetry group, with a text of poems praising the actor, and the image of a peony (one of the Ichikawa family symbols) designed by Totoya Hokkei (1780-1850). The complete print bears Kunisada's seal reading _Kunisada aratame ni-sei Toyokuni no in_ ([Seal of Kunisada changing to Toyokuni II]( /context/textC)), which records his adoption of his master Toyokuni;s name in New Year 1844.

The print was probably designed in 1849, when his son [Danjuro VIII](/exhibition/group-12) went to visit his father Ichikawa Ebizo V (formerly Danjuro VII) in exile in Osaka. Danjuro VII had been banished from Edo by the government (_bakufu_) in 1842 in punishment for his luxurious lifestyle as part of the Tempo reforms. The print shows Danjuro VII in one of his most famous roles, which was depicted many times in prints with the characteristic lightning-in-the-clouds pattern on Fuwa Banzaemon's costume. The device of portraying an actor reflected in a mirror was used by Kunisada many times.
