[![Kawarazaki Shisen (Kawarazaki Gonjuro I) as Umeo-maru and Ichimura Kakitsu (Ichimura Uzaemon XIII) as Sakura-maru in Sugawara denju tenarai kagami (Sugawara and the secrets of calligraphy)](P.86-1999_small1.jpg)](KUN/kunp86.htm)

From the set entitled 'Series Comparing the Diligence of Young Flowers' (_Hana-kurabe shussei-zukushi_), published 11/1861. Kunisada designed several prints in connection with this performance, three of which are included in this exhibition in this case.

This print depicts two of the triplets in the scene called _Kuruma Biki_ (Pulling the Carriage Apart) in which they confront their triplet brother [Matsuo-maru](KUN/kunp85.htm) who serves their enemy Shihei. They each wear a thick padded _dotera_ kimono with a pattern of large purple and white squares (_soshigoshi_). They hold the green wicker hats (_amigasa_) that they have just removed, revealing their faces. Sakuramaru is the more elegant figure with subtle eye make-up known as _mukimi_ ('trough-shell shadows') and divided forelock wig called _mae jasen_ ('front-facing tea whisk'); his more gentle role is traditionally played in a slightly effeminate manner (_wakashugata_). In contrast Umeo-maru is one of the prime examples of the _aragoto_ ('rough-stuff') style of acting, with appropriately fierce red make-up with extra shadow lines (_nihon suji guma_), and extravagant wig with high pom-pom and spoke-like projections on either side, known as the _kuruma bin_ (carriage sidelocks). For this scene he wore muscular body 'make-up', visible on his hands and arms, which was actually dyed onto white silk skin-garments. _Aragoto_ roles were particularly associated with the Danjuro lineage of actors.
