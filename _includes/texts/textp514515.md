The outer sheets of a surimono triptych showing this famous scene from the play first performed with these actors in the same roles as _Ukiyo-zuka hiyoku no inazuma_ (Ukiyo's sword hilt, a double grave mound and the mark of the lightning bolt) at the Ichimura theatre in 1823, and revived many times. The missing central sheet shows Segawa Kikunojo as the teahouse mistress Ofuku who intercedes to stop the ensuing duel. The numerous prints showing this scene depict the characteristic costume patterns of Nagoya Sanza ('swallows-in-the-rain') and Fuwa Banzaemon ('lightning-in-the-clouds'). All three prints also have the 'triple-umbrella' (_sambon-karakusa_) pattern of Nagoya Sanza across the top, and Fuwa's 'lightning-in-the-clouds' pattern embossed in the background. They are each stamped with the inscription _Honchoren sanbantsuki_ (a set of three for the Honcho poetry group).
