From the series _Imayo oshi-e kagami_ (Up-to-date Padded Pictures in Mirrors). Kunisada designed several series of portraits of actors reflected in mirrors. Six prints from this series are included in this exhibition.

This print of 'bamboo-tugging Goro' illustrates the scene in this Spring play (_yayoi kyogen_) in which the dance skit _Edo-ganoko ninin Dojo-ji_ is performed.

The printing includes burnishing (_tsuya-zuri_) on the black. The seal of the leading block-carver Yokokawa Takejiro appears on the print.
