Portrait by Kunisada of [Ichikawa Danjuro VIII](/exhibition/group-12) as Takeda Katsuyori, juxtaposed with a still-life and view of the Koshuya Restaurant at Sotokanda designed by Utagawa Hiroshige I (1797-1858), from the series _[Toto (Edo) komei kaiseki-zukushi](KUN/kunp70.htm)_ (All the Famous Restaurants of Edo).

This was one of several series with landscape backgrounds designed to capitalise on the success of the series of prints with views of the Tokaido published in early 1852.

There is a visual/verbal pun on the word for the fish (_katsuo_) represented in the still-life, which is also part of the name of the character - 'Katsuyori'.

The printing includes blind embossing (_karazuri_) on the sword-handle, collar and hair-ornament and burnishing (_tsuya_\-_zuri_) for the subtle pattern on the red garment (this can be seen only from certain angles on the original).
