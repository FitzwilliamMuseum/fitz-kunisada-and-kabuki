A spring [surimono](/theme/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) commissioned by two poets from Shigaraki in Goshu (Omi) Province. The women are seated in front of a six-panel Kano-school painted screen with a depiction of a pine tree, which was associated with Spring and the New Year. The shamisen was Japan's best-known stringed instrument and the major one accompanying Kabuki and puppet plays. It has three strings, a body covered with skin (initially snake but later dog or cat), and is played with an ivory or tortoise shell plectrum (_bachi_). The _koto_ is a thirteen-stringed harp or zither-like instrument played with two hands.

It was originally a court instrument but during the Edo period became a popular instrument for merchants' daughters to learn for parlour entertainment. Geisha were professional entertainers who would have been expert in playing these instruments for appearances at parties. The first poem, by Tsukinoya Tsuruhiko, suggests that a warbler in a cage sings to the accompaniment of a _koto_ (possibly alluding to the popular comparison of courtesans in the licensed quarters to caged birds). The second poem, by Kachoya Noritsugu, speaks of a warbler singing its spring song amidst fragrant plum blossoms. The imagery in the poems is reflected on the designs of the _kimono_ and _obi_ (sash).
