**Onoe Kikugoro III taking tea at Shinagawa**

c.1825  

Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

This is a 'farewell' [surimono](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) depicting the actor [Onoe Kikugoro III](/exhibition/group-16-part-3) before he departed on his pilgrimage to the Tenjin Shrine at Dazaifu on Kyushu in 10/1825. He is seated on the second-floor balcony of a Shinagawa restaurant at the start of the Tokaido highway. He had just completed performing in the sensational first performance of the most famous of Kabuki ghost plays, _Tokaido Yotsuya kaidan_, which had been written for him by Tsuruya Nanboku IV. Kikugoro achieved great fame for using a series of astonishing costume-changing devices in order to perform three central roles.

Kikugoro's acting crest (_[mon](/themes/actors-names-and-crests)_) appears on the sleeves of his robe. The plum-blossom (_gyoyo-giku_) pattern was also a personal motif of Kikugoro, whose poetry name was Baiko ('Plum luck'). Plum was also associated with the Tenjin Shrine. The bat-motif on the waitress's kimono is a symbol of good luck. The turtle motif on the railing may be the mark of the _kyoka_ poetry club that commissioned the print.
