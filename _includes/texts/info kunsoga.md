**[Segawa Kikunojo V](/exhibition/group-7) as Oiso no Tora Gozen (right) and Sawamura Tossho I as Soga no Juro (left) in _[Kotobuki Soga no taimen](/exhibition/group-6)_ [(The Soga Brothers Confrontation](/exhibition/group-6) _c._1831/2
**Private collection

From the set An Imagined Confrontation of the Three Theatres (_San shibai mitate taimen_), which shows the leading actors of the three competing Edo theatres as the cast for an imagined performance of the most popular of all Kabuki revenge tales. Soga no Juro is paired in this set with his mistress Oiso no Tora Gozen. The hero is shown wearing a monks robe and holding a monks hat. His kimono is decorated with the same flying-plovers pattern as his mistresss. Tossho I (later called Gennosuke II) was noted for his skill in portraying refined young men. This portrait combines his elegant bearing with a sense of his grim determination to be revenged. The role of Juros mistress was in the popular category of steadfast courtesan. It allowed the female-role actor to display the breadth of his acting ability in lyric passages, scenes of amorous dalliance, gentle solicitude, grim determination and farce. Kikunojo V wears the full robes and luxurious hair ornaments of a courtesan. His pose is flirtatious, with the bundle of tissues representing an invitation to erotic dalliance. This was probably the last print of Kikunojo to be issued before his death in 01/1832 at the age of 30.
