[![Sawamura Tanosuke III as Otaka, daughter of Oyamada, in Chushin akatsuki no tori, performed at the Morita theatre from 05/05/1860](P.82-1999_small1.jpg)](KUN/kunp82.htm)

From the series _Imayo oshi-e kagami_ (Up-to-date Padded Pictures in Mirrors). Kunisada designed several series of portraits of actors reflected in mirrors. Six prints from this series are included in this exhibition.

Sawamura Tanosuke III (1845-78) was one of the leading _onnagata_ [(female-role actors)](/context/textG) of his generation. When this print was made he had just become 'head _onnagata_' (_tate onnagata_) at the Morita theatre at the age of fifteen. His good looks and sex appeal assured him a large number of followers and his name became attached to numerous female hair and fashion accessories, including the Tanosuke _mage_ (topknot), the Tanosuke _eri_ (collar) and the Tanosuke _geta_ (clog).

In 1865 he became ill with gangrene, and two years later his hand and foot were amputated. He continued acting for another four years, then retired and died at the age of 33 after going insane.

The printing here includes blind embossing (_karazuri_), textile embossing (_nunome-zuri_) in the background of the floral garment, burnishing (_tsuya-zuri_) on the black part of the mirror, and mica on the blue hair ornament. The seal of the block-carver Yokokawa Takejiro appears on the print.
