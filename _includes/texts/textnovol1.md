Just as in summer we see Mt. Fuji without its covering of snow, so in this book [Kunisada shows us the stars of the Kabuki stage at their leisure,](Group9.htm) without their familiar covering of make-up. Here the [female-role actor (_onnagata_)](textG.htm) Iwai Hanshiro V is shown on an outing to view cherry blossoms with members of his acting 'family'. He and the student-attendant to his left both wear female attire.
