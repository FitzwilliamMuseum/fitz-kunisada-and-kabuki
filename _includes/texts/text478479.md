A [surimono](textP.htm) of an unidentified scene of lovers meeting under a plum tree in a rain storm. Their anxiety suggests that it is probably one of the many love-suicide _michiyuki_ (travel-going) scenes featured in plays about pairs of lovers such as Gonpachi and Komurasaki or Osome and Hisamatsu. Typically the couple in question despair at ever finding happiness in the world and decide to commit double-suicide, often by leaping into the river. Outdoor _michiyuki_ (travel-going) scenes had become a staple part of Kabuki plays by the nineteenth century, and might involve a more hopeful sort of journey, such as lovers on their way to be married. Sometimes _michiyuki_ were performed on their own.
