In this [surimono](textP.htm) both actors wear the traditional wrestlers dress of a folded _haori_ jacket across the shoulders, and a second sash (_uwajime_) over the first to stop it unravelling. The play derived from the puppet theatre and appears to have been based on a true event in which a quarrelsome Sumo wrestler named Nuregami Chogoro killed a samurai and was captured after hiding out at his fathers house in Yawata village.

In the play, Hanaregoma Chokichi is an amateur wrestler whose patron is at odds with Chogoros patron Yogoro. In this scene the two wrestlers engage in a test of strength to see who can crush a tea cup with their bare hand. Chogoro succeeds, but the amateur Chokichi has to cheat by hitting the cup against the guard of his sword (_katana no scuba_). The two later swear allegiance as blood brothers. The words _futatsu_ (two) and _chocho_ (butterflies) in the plays title pun on the wrestlers names, which both include the character _cho_ (long).
