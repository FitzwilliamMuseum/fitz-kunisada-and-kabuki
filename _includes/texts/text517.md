[![Ichikawa Danjuro VII as a pilgrim with Segawa Kikunojo V as a shrine dancer c.1823-5. ](P.517-1937_small1.jpg)](KUN/kunp517.htm)

This unsigned [surimono](textP.htm) may be part of a diptych, with the signature on the missing right-hand sheet, and/or part of a series that involves comparisons with insects. Here the sound of the shrine dancer's _suzu_ bells (lying on the ground), and the ringed staff held by the pilgrim are compared to the sound of insects. The roles and play have yet to be identified.
