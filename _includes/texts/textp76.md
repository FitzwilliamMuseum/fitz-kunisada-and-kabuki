A triptych published by Ebisuya Shoshichi of the Kabuki actors [Nakamura Fukusuke I](/exhibition/group-21) (right), Ichikawa Ichizo III (centre) and [Kawarazaki Gonjuro I](/exhibition/group-18) (left), enjoying a picnic in a plum orchard. The print alludes to [the famous scene](Group15.htm) in which the three heroes of the Chinese kingdom of Shu (Guan Yu, Liu Bei and Zhang Fei) exchanged oaths of brotherhood while drinking wine in a peach orchard. Their tale was best known through the Chinese novel Romance of the three kingdoms, which was introduced into Japan in the early Edo period and remains popular today. The orchard scene often appeared in paintings and prints, such as the [surimono](KUN/kunp504.htm) by Kunisada.
