**Ichikawa Danjuro VII as Soga no Goro and Bando Mitsugoro III as Asaina no Saburo in the armour-pulling scene (_kusazuribiku_)**    
_Kunisada 81_  
1827 Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

A [surimono](/context/textP) of the famous armour-pulling scene (_kusazuribiki_) which had become a highpoint of various Kabuki plays telling of the revenge of the two [Soga brothers,](/exhibition/group-6) Soga no Juro and Soga no Goro, on their fathers murderer Kudo Suketsune. Soga no Goro, believing his brother to be in mortal danger, rushes out from hiding to his defence, only to be held back by the legendary strongman warrior Asaina no Saburo (1176-?) tugging at the skirt of his armour. Goro was said to have held his ground like a guardian statue. This print probably depicts an imaginary performance of a Soga brothers vendetta play, as these actors did not appear in these roles in 1827.

Danjuros costume bears the Soga butterfly crest, while his sword-hilt is decorated with the Ichikawa acting crest (_[mon](/context/textD)_) of three concentric boxes, or triple-rice-measure (_[mimasu](/context/textD)_). Mitsugoros acting crest (_mon_)a circle containing the triple-stroke character for threedecorates his costume.

The first poem puns on the verb _hikeru_, which can refer either to trailing mists or tugging. The other poem likens the curling leaves of springtime bracken ferns to clenched fists.
