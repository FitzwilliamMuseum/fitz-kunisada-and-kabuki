**Iwai Kumesaburo II as a courtesan**

c.1830 Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

In this [surimono](/theme/surimono-and-special-printing-effects), the courtesan stands beneath a night flowering cherry in Yoshiwara, the licensed district in Edo, wearing a robe patterned with water-wheels, gabions and stakes. The poem by Ryuotei Edo no Hananari praises her beauty by combining references to two famous Chinese and Japanese beauties from the past, Yang Kuei-fei and Ono no Komachi. There is a pun on the word Karayamatoya (China-Japan house) because it incorporates Yamatoya, which was the actor [Kumesaburos yago (shop name),](/theme/actors-names-and-crests) the nick-name shouted out by fans to encourage him during a performance. The actors fan-butterfly (ogi-cho) crest (mon) forms part of the design of the hairpins. The iris pattern on the robe was also associated with Kumesaburo.
