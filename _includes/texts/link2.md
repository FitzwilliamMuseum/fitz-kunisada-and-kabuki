### Inside the Theatre

The action on stage is frozen, with the courtesan Agemaki on the right beside the villainous Ikkyu

The line of a circular revolve (_mawari_ _butai_), added to the Nakamura Theatre in 1793, can be seen on the floorboards of the stage.

The curtain of the main stage is pulled aside to the left.

The _tsurieda_ (hanging branches)  a border of artificial branches or flowers  hangs above the main stage.

Music and sound effects for kabuki generally emanated from the geza  a lattice-screened room on the right of the stage  or from the chobo yuka  a lattice-screened booth above the stage-entrance on the right of the stage. Sukerokus entrance-dance (_deba_) was accompanied by strains of offstage kato bushi (shamisen music with strong but elegant singing and clear rhythmic shouts).
