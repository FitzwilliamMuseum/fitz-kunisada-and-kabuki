A posthumous portrait of Onoe Baiju (a name used by [Onoe Kikugoro III](/exhibition/group-16-part-1) in retirement) as [Rokusaburo the carpenter](KUN/kunp72.htm) with a giant carp, from the series _Kiyogaki nanatsu iroha_ (Neatly Written Syllabary in the Seven Styles). On the folding screen at the top the character for the syllable 'Ri' is written out in four different ways with different meanings, and also appears in a poem by Kizugawa Yoemon; one of the possible meanings is 'carp'.

Rokusaburo is the main character in the play _Mijikayo ukina no chirashigaki_, set in the timber yards of Fukugawa. The scene depicted is a 'carp-grappling scene' (_koitsukami_), which originated in the type of summer play (_natsu kyogen_) known as _mizu kyogen_ ('water play'), using tanks of real water (_honmizu_) on stage. Plays with carp-grappling scenes (_koitsukami_ _mono_) involved the hero in underwater combat with the spirit of a giant carp (an elaborate prop). The technique was passed down through the Onoe lineage of actors to [Kikugoro III](/exhibition/group-16-part-1), who made the scene famous in _Kijikayo ukina no chirashigaki_ when it was premiered in 1813 and commemorated in an earlier print by Kunisada. In this print, the spray is achieved by splashing the surface with white pigment.
