A portrait of Ichikawa Ichizo III as [Rokusaburo the carpenter](textp71.htm), made for the forthcoming performances of _Komamukae Tanomino Tsukkomi_ (a version of _Mijikayo ukina no chirashigaki_) at the Morita theatre in 07/1858. Rokusaburo was the main character of the play, and appeared as the subject of [numerous other prints](textp71.htm), especially in this 'carp-grappling scene' (_koitsukami_).

The actor depicted here was the centre of a celebrated incident in 1856 at the Morita theatre, when a samurai in the audience was so caught up in the action that he drew his sword and rushed onto the stage to attack Ichizo III. Several who rushed to help were killed, but Ichizo III only sustained a minor injury and resumed the play some days later, to great success.

The printing in this example includes fabric embossing (_nunome-zuri_) on the headband, burnishing (_tsuya-zuri_) on the black collar and fish-eye, and mica on the fish scales.
