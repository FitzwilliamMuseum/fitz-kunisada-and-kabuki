[![Bando Hikosaburo V as Kudo Saemon ](P.113-1994_small.jpg)](KUN/kun113.htm)

From the series _Tosei jihitsu kagami_ (Mirror of Contemporary Autographs), published 12/1861, with portraits by Kunisada juxtaposed against landscapes or still-lifes designed sometimes by Hiroshige or (in this case) by his pupil Ichiyusai Shigenobu, known as Hiroshige II (1826-69).

This print was evidently intended as advance publicity for the appearance of Bando Hikosaburo in this role at the Nakamura theatre in New Year of 1862. A New Year _hokku_ poem, signed in imitation of the actor's own calligraphy, appears down the right on the _tanzaku_ (long poem card):

> > A blessing to the branches
> >
> > which still do not sprout
> >
> > the east wind of spring.
