Portrait of [Ichikawa Danjuro VIII](/exhibition/group-12) as [Soga no Goro,](/exhibition/group-6) from the series Mitate juni-ka-getsu (Comparisons with the Twelve Months).

The portrait is depicted as though the face is painted on a lantern, and is accompanied by an inset designed by Kunisada II (1823-80) showing a figure running in a sudden evening shower. Plays telling of the [revenge](/exhibition/group-6) taken by the Soga no Goro and his brother Soga no Juro on their father's murderer were traditionally performed at New Year, but there were also quick-change dance pieces (_henge mono_) devoted to single characters, which were performed at other times of year. One of these was _Ame no Goro_ ('Rainfall Goro') or _Tokimune_ first created in 1841 for a festival honouring the Soga brothers.

Its story involves Goro's visit to the pleasure quarters to visit his mistress during a rain-storm. He wears a richly-embroidered robe with the butterfly motif associated with the character, and the sort of red make-up (_beni guma_) and wild-haired wig typical of the _aragoto_ ('rough-stuff') roles specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage of actors.

Each actor in this series is matched with a month; the connection in this print may be that the revenge in the Soga story took place in the fifth month. The iris is the symbol of the Fifth Month.
