Portrait of Ichikawa Ebizo V (formerly [Danjuro](/exhibition/group-8-part-1)Â  [VII](/context/textE)) as Dainagon Yorimoto, juxtaposed with a poem by Kiichi Hogen, from the series _Mitate sanju-rokkasen no uchi_ (Comparisons with the Thirty-six Immortals of Poetry).

Published by Iseya Kanekichi. After the success of the similar series with views of the [Tokaido](/exhibition/group-1) published in early 1852, Kunisada designed several other sets with landscape backgrounds. Dainagon Yorimoto was one of the thirty-six 'Immortal' poets first selected and listed by the 11th-century poet and critic, Fujiwara no Kinto.

The military strategist Kiichi Hogen was the subject of a number of plays, which centred on the attempts of the Genji and Taira clans to gain control over the three-volume scroll-book (_sanryaku no maki_) that he had written on military tactics.

The remarkable hair and beard are depicted entirely by embossing the paper with a carved block (_karazuri_) there is no ink involved. _Nikawa_ (animal glue) was applied with a brush to the eyes
