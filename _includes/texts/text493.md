Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

This [surimono](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) is sealed beneath Kunisada's signature with the artist's _sada_ seal in the form of the _mimasu_ (triple-rice-measure) box which was the Ichikawa lineage acting crest [(_mon_).](/themes/actors-names-and-crests) It also bears the [production seal](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) of Kubo Shumman (1757-1820), indicating that Kunisada's design was cut and printed by the Shumman studio. It was commissioned by the Go poetry group, whose stylised symbol made up of the character for 'five' (_go_) is used as the pattern on the upper part of Danjuro IV's outer robe.

The surimono may have been intended as a memorial to Danjuro IV, and celebrates roles which were specialities of the Ichikawa lineage of actors. _Kagekiyo_ was revived and revised by Danjuro IV and included by Danjuro VII in his selection of Eighteen Plays (_Kabuki Juhachiban_) specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage. The Ichikawa _[mimasu](/themes/actors-names-and-crests)_ [crest (_mon_)](/themes/actors-names-and-crests) is seen on the hilt of Danjuro IV's sword. He holds in a bag the precious _biwa_ (lute) called Seizan, which Kagekiyo is hiding from his Genji enemies.

Danjuro VII is shown in the foreground holding a fan in one hand, which is embossed with the silver triple stripe (_misuji_) associated with the Ichikawa lineage. In the other hand he holds a medicine packet bearing the character _uira\[u\]_, referring to the medicine _uiro_, which was supposed to cure everything from constipation to bad breath. The larger black case on his back has the characters for \[O\]dawara, the place where the medicine was produced. _Uiro_ sellers were famous for their high-pitched voices and rapid sales-talk. Danjuro II, celebrated for his elocution, incorporated a _uiro_ seller into a play on a [Soga](/exhibition/group-6) theme in 1718 (_Wakamidori ikioi Soga_), in which he is actually Soga no Juro in disguise. Danjuro VII wears the costume associated with this role: decorated with lucky coins and with a lining motif of sacred _shimenawa_ ropes and dangling paper streamers. He later incorporated the role into a performance of _Sukeroku yukari no Edo zakura_ (Sukeroku's affinity for the cherry blossoms of Edo), in which he passed the Danjuro name onto his ten-year-old son, who became [Danjuro VIII.](/exhibition/group-12)


The poem on the surimono by Dokurakudo Takamori weaves into a standard New Year _kyoka_ an allusion to the famed verbal gymnastics of the _uiro_ seller, which in the play were supposedly due to the piece of _uiro_ that he had put into his mouth:

_Saku ume no_  With the scent of plum _kaori fukumeba_ blossoms filling its mouth, _ima masa ni_ the warbler in the courtyard _shita yoku mawaru_ is now readied to recite _yado no uguisu_ its elegant tongue-twisters.
