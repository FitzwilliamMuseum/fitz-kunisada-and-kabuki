From the set of nine designs entitled _[Tosei oshi-e hagoita � atari kyogen no uchii](KUN/kun327.htm)_ [(Modern cloth-picture battledores � stage hits).](KUN/kun327.htm) Danjuro VII is depicted as Soga no Goro in _[Yanone](Group6.htm)_ [(The arrow-sharpener),](Group6.htm) one of the popular plays based on the story of the revenge of the Soga brothers on their father's murderer, Suketsune. This virtuoso role was performed in the most extravagant 'rough stuff' (_aragoto_) style of acting developed by the [Danjuro lineage](textD.htm) of actors. It allowed Danjuro VII to display his mastery in the portrayal of swash-buckling heroes. The striking face-paint, which is typical of such heroic roles, expresses the intensity of the character's feelings. In this instance the hero, burning with rage, sharpens a double-tipped arrow with which he and his brother intend to avenge their father's murder.
