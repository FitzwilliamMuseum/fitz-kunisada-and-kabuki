[![Shono Kameyama kan Morishita Hori no Rammaru (Morishita, between Shono and Kameyama: Hori no Rammaru](P.62-1999_small1.jpg)](KUN/kunp62.htm)

A portrait of Ichikawa Saruzo as Hori no Rammaru, with a view of Morishita on the [Tokaido](/exhibition/group-1) Highway in the background, from the [series](KUN/kunp60.htm) _Tokaido gojusan tsugi no uchi_ (Fifty-three stations of the Tokaido Highway). As with all the prints in this series (two of them shown here), the landscape in the background is heavily indebted to a print in Hiroshige's famous series of Tokaido views published 20 years earlier. According to the advertisements for the series, Kunisada was inspired by the late Onoe Kikugoro III (1784-1849) who, in the last year of his life, had walked the length of the Tokaido giving performances along the way.

The publication was so ambitious that four publishers collaborated: Izutsaya, Iseya, Tsugiokaya and Sumiyoshiya. Initially the plan was for the whole series to be cut by the block-carver Yokogawa Takejiro and printed by Oumiya Hisagoro, but the size of the project led to other craftsmen being brought in.
