From the series of fifteen Spring _kyoka_ [surimono](textP.htm) entitled _[Niwatori-awase](KUN/kunp482.htm)_ [(A contest of fowls)](KUN/kunp482.htm), commissioned by the Taiko poetry group for the year of the cock.

A young _samurai_ (feudal lord) and attendant are depicted in front of a screen on which is painted the famous _Shikoro biki_ (armour-pulling) incident from the Battle of Yashima, involving Minonoya Shiro and Kagekiyo, two of the leading warriors from the Gempei wars. Many of the Kabuki plays featuring the character [Kagekiyo](Group14.htm) included a _shikoro biki_ (armour-pulling) scene.
