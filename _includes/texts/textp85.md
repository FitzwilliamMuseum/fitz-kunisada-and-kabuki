[![Nakamura Shikan IV as the guard Matsuo-maru in Sugawara denju tenarai kagami (Sugawara and the secrets of calligraphy) performed at the Ichimura theatre from 17/10/1861](P.85-1999_small1.jpg)](KUN/kunp85.htm)

From the series _[Tosei jihitsu kagami](KUN/kun113.htm)_ (Mirror of Contemporary Autographs), published 12/1861, with portraits by Kunisada juxtaposed against landscapes or still-lifes. This print, published in 11/1861, was one of several designed by Kunisada in connection with the same production, three of which are included in this exhibition. Here the villain Matsuo-maru appears in the scene called _Kuruma biki_ (Pulling the carriage apart), which the Kabuki version had added to the original puppet play. The stage setting is conjured up in the _hokku_ poem, signed in imitation of the actor's own calligraphy, which appears to the left on the _tanzaku_ (long poem card) decorated with pine needle and cone motifs:

_Kamigaki ya_  Within the shrine fence

_yo no ki wa nakute_  none of the other trees

_matsu no hana_ is as flowery as the pine.

The poem puns on the word _matsu_, 'pine', which forms part of the name of _Matsu_o-maru. The scene is set at Yoshida Shrine in Kyoto, with stage props usually including a _torii_ gate, a low red _kamigaki_ shrine fence (as mentioned in the poem), and cherry (_sakura_) and plum (_ume_) trees in reference to the names of Matsuo-maru's triplet brothers, _[Sakura](KUN/kunp86.htm)_[\-maru and _Ume_o-maru.](KUN/kunp86.htm) By comparing the trees, the poem also suggests that the role of Matsuomaru is more prominent than the others in this play.
