
**The female-role actor (_onnagata_) Segawa Kikunojo V c. 1822**
_Kunisada 4_  
Private collection  

From a set of ten prints entitled _Hotarugari Edokko soroi_ (Firefly catching a line-up of Edo folk), depicting actors in the roles of typical Edo characters dressed for a summer firefly hunt. This impression is from a limited deluxe printing. It is on thicker paper than usual and employs more subtle pigments than those encountered in standard commercially issued prints.

The nuances of printing enhance the impact of the graceful design, with its lilting sense of arrested motion. Particularly effective is the wiping of colour blocks to allow one colour to shade gradually into another. The [purple patch](/context/textG) covering Kikunojo V's shaved pate and his coarse features identified him as a man, yet in dress and deportment he represented the essence of femininity.

The butterfly that decorates his fan is the identifying feature of the [crest (_mon_)](/context/textD) of the Kikunojo lineage of actors.
