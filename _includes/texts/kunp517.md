**Ichikawa Danjuro VII as a pilgrim with SegawaÂ Kikunojo V as a shrine dancer**
_Kunisada 76_

c. 1823-5. Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

This unsigned [surimono](/context/textP) may be part of a diptych, with the signature on the missing right-hand sheet, and/or part of a series that involves comparisons with insects. Here the sound of the shrine dancer's _suzu_ bells (lying on the ground), and the ringed staff held by the pilgrim are compared to the sound of insects. The roles and play have yet to be identified.
