[![Nakamura Fukusuke I (Shikan IV) as Tomo-yakko Fukuhei](P.83-1999_small.jpg)](KUN/kunp83.htm)

From the series _Imayo oshi-e kagami_ (Up-to-date Padded Pictures in Mirrors). Kunisada designed several series of portraits of actors reflected in mirrors. Six prints from this series are included in this exhibition.

The act entitled _Tomo yakko_ was a _Yakko mono_ ('footman play') that originally formed part of the quick-change dance play _Nijiri Gaki Nanatsu Iroha_. The role of the footman was made famous in 1828 by its first exponent [Shikan II](Group20.htm) (adoptive father of Fukusuke I), so _Tomo Yakko_ was sometimes known as the 'Shikan play' (_Shikan mono_) and the character usually wore the Shikan _mon_ (crest) on his costume. The piece involves the colourfully dressed footman, something of a dandy, performing a dance with exaggerated steps (_tanzen roppo_).

The printing includes blind embossing (_karazuri_) and burnishing (_tsuya-zuri_) on the black. The seal of the leading block-carver Yokokawa Takejiro appears on the print.
