[![Ichimura Takenojo V as Abe no Yasuna](P.90-1999_small.jpg)](KUN/kunp90.htm)

From an untitled series of large-head portraits (_okubi-e_) made in the last years of Kunisada's life and employing only the most expensive materials and the finest block-carvers and printers. It was recognised by his contemporaries as his masterpiece. It was the first set of _oban_ (full-sheet) large heads since Utamaro's and Sharaku's series in the 1790s. By Kunisada's death 72 prints were completed, some of them designed by his assistant Utagawa Yoshitora (active _c._1850-80). All of the actors in Kunisada's designs gave performances during his lifetime. Their various names are listed in the cartouche: here the actor's poetry name _Kako_ is included. This is a posthumous portrait of Takenojo V (1812-51), who was known for his excessive lifestyle: during an illness in 1847 he made a pilgrimage to Narita with a party of forty, including hairdressers, chanters, and geisha, etc, taking ten days to return because of the constant partying.

Yasuna was the eponymous hero of a popular play premiered by [Onoe Kikugoro III](Group16pt1.htm) and revived by [Danjuro IX.](Group18.htm) He makes his entrance on the _hanamichi_ (the raised passage-way leading from the back of the audience to the main stage) with loose hair, and wearing a _yamai hachimake_ (illness headband). He is driven to madness by the suicide of his mistress, whose kimono he carries draped over his shoulder as he wanders through the countryside. He imagines that he sees her in the spring fields, but realising that he is alone he breaks down and weeps, clutching her garment.

The play was unusual among madness pieces (_kyoran mono_) in featuring a male instead of the usual female character.
