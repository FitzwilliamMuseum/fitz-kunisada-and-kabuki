A posthumous portrait of Onoe Baiju (a name used by [Onoe Kikugoro III](/exhibition/group-16-part-1) in retirement and to sign poems) as [Rokusaburo the carpenter](KUN/kunp72.htm) with a giant carp, from the series _Kiyogaki nanatsu iroha_ (Neatly Written Syllabary in the Seven Styles). On the folding screen at the top the character for the syllable 'Ri' is written out in four different ways with different meanings, and also appears in a poem by Kizugawa Yoemon; one of the possible meanings is 'carp'.
