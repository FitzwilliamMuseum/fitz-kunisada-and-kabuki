Spring _kyoka_ [surimono](textP.htm) showing the scene of Mongaku Shonin (1120-99) reciting prayers under the icy waterfall of Nachi in penance for accidentally killing his lover. He witnesses a manifestation of the Buddhist deity Fudo Myo-o (the guardian of waterfalls) who appears at the top with his two attendants (_doji_) Kongara and Seitaka. A number of plays were derived from this story, based on the Heike monogatari (Tales of the Heike) and _Gempei seisuiki_ (Account of the Genpei wars), but this is evidently an 'imaginary grouping', rather than a record of an actual production, as Kunisada depicts Danjuro VII's deceased grandfather, Danjuro V, in the role of Fudo. The scene had a special significance for the Danjuro lineage of actors ever since their founder, Danjuro I (1660-1704), prayed successfully to the image of Fudo at the Shinshoji temple in Narita, and thereafter used Naritaya as his _[yago](textD.htm)_ [('house name'),](textD.htm) the nickname shouted out by fans to encourage him during performance. Before assuming the Danjuro stage-name, actors performed the same religious purification (_misogi_) as Mongaku at the waterfall at Shinshoji, where it was believed that the spirit of Fudo came to inhabit them. A votive plaque painted by Kunisada at the temple also records this scene.

The poem by Umenoya plays irreverently by associating Fudo's coiled rope with the rope used to wrap wine casks as temple or shrine offerings, and by transforming the penitential waterfall (_taki_) into a famous brand of wine, _Takisui_ (literally, 'water from a waterfall'), which was sold at the Yomo wine shop in Izumicho in the Kanda district of Edo.
