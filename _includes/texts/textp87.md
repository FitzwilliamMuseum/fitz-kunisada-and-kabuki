[![Kawarazaki Gonjuro I (Danjuro IX) backstage applying make-up for the role of Umeo-maru i](P.87-1999_small2.jpg)](KUN/kunp87.htm)

Published in 12/1861. Kunisada designed several prints in connection with this performance, three of which are displayed in this case. Umeo-maru is one of the prime examples of the _aragoto_ or 'rough-stuff' style of kabuki role, with appropriately fierce red make-up (_nipponsujigama_) applied on a white base, and an extravagant wig (seen on the wig-stand) with high pom-pom and spoke-like projections on either side, known as the _kuruma bin_ (carriage sidelocks). Gonjuro I can be seen as [Umeo-maru](KUN/kunp86.htm) in another print in this exhibition.
