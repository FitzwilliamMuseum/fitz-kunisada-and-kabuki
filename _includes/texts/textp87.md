**[Kawarazaki Gonjuro I](/exhibition/group-18) (Danjuro IX) [backstage](/exhibition/group-13) applying make-up for the role of Umeo-maru in _[Sugawara denju tenarai kagami](/exhibition/group-3)_ (Sugawara and the secrets of calligraphy) performed at the Ichimura theatre from 17/10/1861**

Given by the Friends of the Fitzwilliam with the aid of the MGC Purchase Grant Fund and the National Art Collections Fund

Published in 12/1861. Kunisada designed several prints in connection with this performance, three of which are displayed in this case. Umeo-maru is one of the prime examples of the _aragoto_ or 'rough-stuff' style of kabuki role, with appropriately fierce red make-up (_nipponsujigama_) applied on a white base, and an extravagant wig (seen on the wig-stand) with high pom-pom and spoke-like projections on either side, known as the _kuruma bin_ (carriage sidelocks). Gonjuro I can be seen as Umeo-maru in another print in this exhibition.
