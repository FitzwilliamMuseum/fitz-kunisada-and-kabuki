**Bando Hikosaburo V as Kudo Saemon in _Sano kei zu Soga no gosho-zome_ [(A Sano lineage Soga of courtly hue)](/exhibition/group-6) performed at the Nakamura theatre from 01/1862**

Given by David Scrase 1994

Published in 12/1861 as part of the series _Tosei jihitsu kagami_ (Mirror of Contemporary Autographs).

From the series _Tosei jihitsu kagami_ (Mirror of Contemporary Autographs), published 12/1861, with portraits by Kunisada juxtaposed against landscapes or still-lifes designed sometimes by Hiroshige or (in this case) by his pupil Ichiyusai Shigenobu, known as Hiroshige II (1826-69).

This print was evidently intended as advance publicity for the appearance of Bando Hikosaburo in this role at the Nakamura theatre in New Year of 1862. A New Year _hokku_ poem, signed in imitation of the actor's own calligraphy, appears down the right on the _tanzaku_ (long poem card):

> A blessing to the branches
which still do not sprout
the east wind of spring.
