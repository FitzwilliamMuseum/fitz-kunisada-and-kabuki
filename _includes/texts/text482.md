**_Goban migi - midare-dori_ (Number five, right: mixed cock-crows)**  _c_ 1825  

Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

From the series of fifteen Spring _kyoka_ [surimono](textP.htm) entitled _[Tori-awase](KUN/kunp483.htm)_ [(A contest of fowls)](KUN/kunp483.htm), commissioned by the Taiko poetry group for the year of the cock. The series involved pictorial puns on the name of varieties of birds. It was unusual in that it consisted of six pairs of prints (right and left) designed by Shinsai and Kunisada, and a triptych by Hokkei. The pair to this print has not been identified. 'Mixed cock-crows' (_midare-dori_) was a poetic term expressing a time late in the dawn; it is also the title on the cover of the _Meriyasu keiko-bon_ (instruction manual for popular ballads) which the young girl is using for her _shamisen_ lesson. She is dressed up in a new _kimono_ and with her hair arranged for the first music lesson of the New Year. Music was often taught by female instructors, particularly popular music.
