Retrospective portrait of Ichikawa Hakuen ([Danjuro](/exhibition/group-8-part-1)Â  [VII](/context/textE)) as Akaiwa Ikkaku, from the [series](KUN/kunp68.htm) _Hakkenden inu no soshi no uchi_ ([Tale of the Eight Dogs](/exhibition/group-23)). Another print from the series is displayed alongside.

The story comes from Takizawa Baikin's quasi-historical novel, _Nanso Satomi Hakkenden_ [(Biography of the Eight Dogs)](/exhibition/group-23), issued over many years (1814-22, 1827-33, 1835-42) with illustrations by several artists including Kunisada. The novel tells the story of nine generations of the fictional Satomi clan, and of [eight samurai,](KUN/kunp65.htm) each of whom represents a different samurai virtue and has the word for 'dog' (_inu_) as part of his name. The story was adapted for Kabuki for the first time in 1834, with numerous subsequent versions, including Sakurada Jisuke III's _Satomi Hakkenden_, produced in 1852, when this series was issued. A month later Kunisada issued a print of one of the eight samurai in his series _Kiso rokuju-kyu tsugi_ (Sixty-nine Kiso Stations).
