Published shortly before Kunisada's death, this print is signed _Shichijukyu-sai Toyokuni hitsu_ ('from the brush of the seventy-nine-year-old Toyokuni'). A poem in the actor's own hand is printed at top left, signed with his [poetry name,](/context/textD) Sansho.

Kunisada had depicted successive generations of the Ichikawa lineage of actors in the role of [Gongoro in _Shibaraku!_,](/exhibition/group-2) which was one of the great examples of the 'rough-stuff' style (_aragoto_) for which the Ichikawa line of actors was famous. All of Kunisada's prints depict the moment of the character's entrance, one of the highpoints of all kabuki. Narita Goro is on the point of executing the innocent Yoshitsuna and his fiancï¿½e, when the voice of Gongoro comes from the rear of the theatre shouting _'Shibaraku! Shibaraku!'_ ('Stop right there!'). The hero then strides onto the _hanamichi_ passageway leading through the audience, wearing the most extravagant costume: a voluminous _suo_ ('plain sliding-door') robe, with the Ichikawa crest (_mon_) of triple-rice-measures (_mimasu_) adorning square sleeves so wide that they have to be supported with splints.
