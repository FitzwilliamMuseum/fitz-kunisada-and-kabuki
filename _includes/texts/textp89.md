1862

Given by the Friends of the Fitzwilliam with the aid of the MGC Purchase Grant Fund and the National Art Collections Fund

From the series _Tosei mitate sanju-rokkasen_ (Comparison of roles with the thirty-six flowers at their zenith). The grouping of thirty-six, which was common in prints (flowers, views of Fuji, etc.), alludes to the grouping of thirty-six 'immortal poets' first selected and listed by the 11th-century poet and critic, Fujiwara no Kinto.

The use of acid background colours in this set (using newly available pigments) is particularly striking.
