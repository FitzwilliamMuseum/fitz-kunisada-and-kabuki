From the series _[Tosei mitate sanju-rokkasen](KUN/kunp88.htm)_ (Comparison of roles with the thirty-six flowers at their zenith). The grouping of thirty-six, which was common in prints (flowers, views of Fuji, etc.), alludes to the grouping of [thirty-six 'immortal poets'](KUN/kunp69.htm) first selected and listed by the 11th-century poet and critic, Fujiwara no Kinto.

The use of acid background colours in this set (using newly available pigments) is particularly striking
