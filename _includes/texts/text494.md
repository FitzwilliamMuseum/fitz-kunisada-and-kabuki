**_Hana no cho_ (Butterfly on the flowers)**

Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

A [surimono](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) made for the song _Hana no cho_ by Sono no Kocho, probably identifiable with the _kyoka_ poet Ryuotei Edo no Hananari who commissioned other surimono with the _kocho_ (buttterfly) seal found on this print (see also the [surimono entitled _Flower_](KUN/kunp489.htm)). Kocho (butterfly) was the symbol and possibly also the name of the poetry club to which he belonged.

This is one of many prints showing a geisha reading a love letter. The quality and design of the scroll shows that the woman's admirer was anxious to appear rich, and his letter boasts of being literate in both Japanese and Chinese. He assures her of his love, heedless of the misfortune predicted by fortune-tellers and the fear of becoming the talk of the town.

Nothing, he concludes, can prevent the two of them, he the butterfly and she the flower, from coming together, despite the many hedges between them. The artist suggests her acquiescence by the butterflies on her pin and her kimono. The detail of the scroll is remarkable; and one character was amended after printing with a tiny piece of paper stuck over the top Kunisada's _sada_ seal here takes the form of the _[mimasu](/themes/actors-names-and-crests)_ (triple rice measure), which was the Ichikawa family of actors' crest (_[mon](/themes/actors-names-and-crests)_).
