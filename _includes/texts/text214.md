From the 1820s to 1860s memorial portraits featured regularly in the output of Edo publishers, many of them designed by Kunisada. He even produced more than one design of the same actor for competing publishers. The prints generally gave the actor's stage name, date of death, age at the time of death, his 'farewell poem', funereal name, and the temple that would be entrusted with his remains. The deceased was depicted out of role sometimes in formal dress, sometimes in a Buddhist monk's robes (or nun's robes if they specialised in female-roles). Whereas all other memorial prints of the 1820s and 30s showed the deceased full-figure (standing or seated), this print is exceptional in depicting the noted [female-role actor (_onnagata_)](/themes/fan-prints-two) Segawa Kikunojo V half-length. He is shown in female attire and simple woman's coiffure with a square cloth covering his shaved forehead. Rather than holding the customary prayer beads, he is shown holding a packet of the leading face powder of the day. Such 'product placement' was rare in actor prints, but was often encountered in prints of beautiful women. The stylised butterflies decorating the black frame of this print and ornamenting Kikunojo's hairpin would have been recognised as the actor's crest [(_mon_)](/themes/actors-names-and-crests) of Kikunojo; butterflies were also taken to represent the soul of the recently deceased.
