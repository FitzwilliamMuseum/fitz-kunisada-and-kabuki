[![Sendo Matsuemon � Shodoya (Matsuemon the Boatman: Shokintei)](P.70-1999_small.jpg)](KUN/kunp70.htm)

Memorial portrait by Kunisada of Nakamura Utaemon IV (who had died in 02/1852) as Matsuemon the Boatman, juxtaposed with a view designed by Utagawa Hiroshige I (1797-1858) of the Shokin-tei Restaurant (named as the Shodoya on the print), from the series _Toto (Edo) komei kaiseki-zukushi_ (All the Famous Restaurants of Edo).

This was one of several series with landscape backgrounds designed to capitalise on the success of the series of prints with views of the [Tokaido](Group1.htm) published in early 1852. Another print from this series, **_[Takeda Katsuyori � Koshuya](KUN/kUNP10.htm)_**[_,_](KUN/kUNP10.htm) has just been added to the Fitzwilliam Museum's collection: click on its title to see it.

Portraits of Utaemon IV sold particularly well in the year following his death in 02/1852, as they became part of the wave of [memorial portraits](textP59.htm) (_[tsuizen-e](text214.htm)_) to the actor. It is recorded that a portrait of Utaemon IV in Kunisada's Tokaido series sold in 8,000 impression for this reason (and the publisher held a party to celebrate!).
