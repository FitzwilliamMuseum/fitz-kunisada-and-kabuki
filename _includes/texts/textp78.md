[![chikawa Kodanji IV (Beisho) as Osho Kichisa in Sannin Kichisa kuruwa no hatsugai, performed at the Ichimura theatre from 01/14/1860](P.78-1999_small1.jpg)](KUN/kunp78.htm)

From the series _[Imayo oshi-e kagami](Group11.htm)_ (Up-to-date Padded Pictures in Mirrors). Kunisada designed several series of portraits of actors reflected in mirrors. Six prints from this series are included in this exhibition.

This print commemorates the first performance of this _kizewamono_ (raw domestic drama), written by Kawatake Mokuami. The main strand of the plot concerns three honourable thieves, each of whom is called Kichisa. They swear blood brotherhood and end up killing each other rather than give themselves up to the police. Ishikawa Kodanji IV took the part of the ex-priest Osho Kichisa.

This is from a luxury edition on thick paper with special printing effects, including blind embossing (_karazuri_), textile embossing (_nunome-zuri_) on the neckerchief and burnishing (_tsuya-zuri_) on the black. The seal of the leading block-carver Yokokawa Takejiro appears on the print.
