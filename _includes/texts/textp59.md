Published by Kamaya Kihei, this is one of a series of memorial portraits (_[tsuizen-e](KUN/kun214.htm)_) of Nakamura [Utaemon IV](/exhibition/group-20) that appeared soon after his death in 02/1852. The number of these published in Edo (Tokyo) was extraordinary, given that he had been acting in Osaka for the last two years of his life. His final role is depicted in this print.

Taira no Kiyomori (1118-81), who defeated the Minamoto (or Genji) clan in 1159 and presided over the subsequent rule of the Taira (or Heike) clan as a dictatorial Chancellor of the Empire. The story of the feud between the two families was told in the _Heike Monogatari_ (Tale of the Heike), and became the subject of numerous plays.

This print is in the medium-sized format called _chuban_ ('medium sheet') as opposed to the full-sized _oban_ ('full-sheet') format used for the rest of the prints in this exhibition. The _chuban_ format was used extensively for actor prints in Osaka.
