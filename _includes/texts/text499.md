This diptych commemorates the debut of Danjuro VII's eldest son in the central role of this play. The role is one of the great examples of the 'rough-stuff' style (_aragoto_) for which the Ichikawa line of actors was famous. Danjuro VIII is striking a defiant pose on the raised passageway (_hanamichi_) leading from the back of the theatre through the audience to the main stage, while his father, playing the role of the villain, looks on from the main stage.

This is the great moment when Narita Goro, on the point of executing the innocent Yoshitsuna and his fiance, is halted by the powerful voice of Gongoro coming from the rear of the theatre shouting _'Shibaraku! Shibaraku!'_ ('Stop right there!'). The hero then strides onto the _hanamichi_ wearing the most extravagant _aragoto_ costume: a voluminous _suo_ ('plain sliding-door') robe, with the Danjuro _[mon](textD.htm)_ [](../textD.htm) adorning square sleeves so wide that they have to be supported with splints. Laudatory poems fill the space above the figures. This impression, the only known surviving example of this diptych, has faded: the thick cord around Danjuro VIII's neck was originally bright red, and the thin cord was purple.
