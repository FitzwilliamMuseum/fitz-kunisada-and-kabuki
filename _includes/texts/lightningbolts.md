**Ichikawa Ebizo V (formerly [Danjuro VII)](../Group8pt1.htm) as Fuwa Banzaemon (right) and [Onoe Kikugoro III](../Group16pt1.htm) as Nagoya Sanza (left) in _[Nagoya obi kumo ni inazuma](../Group4.htm)_ [(A Nagoya rope sash and robes with lightning bolts amidst clouds](../Group4.htm)) performed at the Morita Theatre in 09/1836**Private collection

This pair of portraits commemorates a revival (with a different name) of the play that brought Danjuro VII (now acting as Ebizo V) and Kikugoro III together in these highly successful roles. The well-known rivalry between the two actors added spice to their confrontation in this famous ['Scabbards clashing' (_Saya-ate_) scene](../Group4.htm) in the third act, which had featured in prints associated with earlier productions. Fuwa Banzaemon carries a sword named 'Thunder' and wears a kimono decorated with a pattern of 'lightning-in-the-clouds'. His rival Nagoya Sanza carries a sword named 'Amorous Swallows' and wears a kimono with a 'swallows-in-the-rain' pattern tied with a sash of knitted rope. Unaware of each other, they make simultaneous entrances boasting of their fame, along the two raised passageways (_hanamichi_) that run through the audience to the main stage. As they pass on the main stage, which represents Nakano Street in the Yoshiwara pleasure district at cherry blossom time, their sword hilts clash. They exchange insults, remove their green sedge travelling-hats, recognize one another and draw swords to fight over the courtesan Katsuragi, whom they both love.

Above the actors' heads are _hokku_ poems (_haiku_) written by the actors themselves. Danjuro's poem is signed with his [poetry name _Hakuen_.](../textD.htm) It alludes to his repeated appearances in this role and to the lightning-in-the-clouds pattern on his robe, as well as to the date of this performance in the ninth month.

Bolts of lightning                 _Inazuma mo
_appear countless times _kazu o kasanete_in the ninth month!              _kugatsu_ _kana._

Kikugoro's poem is signed with his [poetry name _Baiko_.](../textD.htm) As well as alluding to the swallows-in the-rain pattern on his robes, the poem suggests a comparison between the action in this scene when the actors pass each other on stage, and geese and swallows flying past each other as one arrives and the other departs in the autumn, the season of this performance:

Passing by each other _Yuki-chigau_wild geese and swallows � _kari ni tsubame ya_over ripened pampas grass. _hanasusuki._
