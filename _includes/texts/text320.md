**Sawamura Tossho I as Karigane Bunshishi 1833**

Private collection

From the set _Tosei gonin otoko_ (A Modern 'Five chivalrous men'), in which a modern version of the group of plays about Karigane's 'Five chivalrous men' gang (_Karigane gonin otoko_) is performed by five popular actors. [Karigane Bunshichi](KUN/kunp75.htm) was the leader of the 'Five Chivalrous Men', a gang of outlaws who were executed in 1702. The exploits of the gang provided the basis for many puppet and (later) Kabuki plays. Eventually the characters ceased to be villains; they were transformed into feisty _otokodate_  heroic commoners who stood up to wicked _samurai_.
