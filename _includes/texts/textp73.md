[![Hana-no-en no bansho Katsuragi (Flower Banquet, Evening Bell: Katsuragi)](P.73-1999.jpg)](KUN/kunp73.htm)

A portrait of Iwai Kumesaburo III as Katsuragi, a character from _Nisemurasaki Inaka Genji_ (An imposter Murasaki and a rustic Genji) by Ryutei Tanehiko, from the series _Genji mitate hakkei no uchi_ (An 'Eight Views' _Genji_). The novel known as 'Rustic Genji', a parody version of the classic _Tale of Genji_, was issued serially from 1829 with illustrations by Kunisada. It was a publishing phenomenon, being the first book in Japan to sell over 10,000 copies.

The landscape background was designed by Utagawa Kunihisa (1832-91), a pupil of Kunisada who moved into Kunisada's house in Yanagishima, just north of Kameido Shrine, after he married Kunisada's third daughter, Okatsu, in 1852.

The carving and printing of this series is particularly spectacular in luxury impressions such as this; note, for instance, the burnishing to create additional patterns in the purple kimono and [red cartouche](KUN/kunp73colllum.htm), and the elaborate embossing to create the pattern in the [white collar and other parts of the costume.](KUN/kunp73coldetail.htm)
