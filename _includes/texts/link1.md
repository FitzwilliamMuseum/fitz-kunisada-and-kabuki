Inside the Theatre

Ichikawa Danjuro VII as Sukeroku makes his entrance along the _hon hanamichi_ a raised walkway that passes through the audience to the main stage. He has paused at the _shichisan_, a position seven-tenths along the _hanamichi_, to perform his _deba_ or entrance-dance. He is wearing Sukeroku�s characteristic purple headband (_hachimaki_) tied at the right temple and carries his bullseye-patterned umbrella. In front of the actor crouches a stage-hand (_koken_) holding a candle or �face-light(_tsura akari_) and wearing a costume decorated on the back with Danjuro�s acting crest (_mon_), the triple-rice measure box (_mimasu_).

The lanterns hanging from the ceiling of the auditorium bear the actorscrests (_mon_), among which Danjuro�s mimasu (triple-rice-measure box) is particularly prominent.

One of Danjuro�s fans in the groundlings or doma (�earth space�) is wearing a headscarf bearing the actor�s crest (_mon_), the triple-rice-measure box (_mimasu_). 


The high windows at the sides of the auditorium provided the main source of daylight to illuminate the performance.

The roof light (with two people here sneaking a bird�s-eye view of the performance) provided a secondary source of daylight to illuminate the performance.
