In Act VII of this famous play about the revenge of the forty-seven samurai, the leader of the band, Yuranosuke, is found playing the profligate in a brothel in order to deceive his enemy's spies. In the scene depicted here, Heiemon, a foot soldier in the service of their deceased master, approaches Yuranosuke and asks to be allowed to join in his plot against the powerful courtier who was responsible for their master's downfall. Yuranosuke denies the existence of any such plot and claims he is under no obligation to avenge their master's disgrace and death. Heiemon remonstrates with him but Yuranosuke pretends to fall asleep. Their dialogue is inscribed on the print. Yuranosuke eventually led his fellow samurai against their common enemy and they succeeded in killing him. They all then committed suicide.
