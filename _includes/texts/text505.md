[![Iwai Shijaku I and Ichikawa Danjuro VII in a Gempei play ](P.505-1937_small.jpg)](KUN/kunp505.htm)

In this [surimono](textP.htm) Shijaku's unidentified character has round her neck the end of the white flag of the Genji (Minamoto) clan held by the warrior played by Danjuro VII. The play, which is yet to be identified, was evidently one of the many based on the _Gempei seisuiki_ (Account of the Gempei wars) and _Heike monogatari_ (Tales of the Heike), involving incidents from the wars between the Heike (Taira) and the Genji (Minamoto) clans in the twelfth century. Iwai Shijaku (1804-45), his father [Iwai Hanshiro V](textnovol1.htm) (1776-1847), and his brother [Iwai Kumesaburo II](Group19.htm) (1799-1836), were (along with [Segawa Kikunojo V](Group7.htm)) the leading female impersonators (_onnagata_) of the Bunka (1804-17) and Bunsei (1818-29) eras.
