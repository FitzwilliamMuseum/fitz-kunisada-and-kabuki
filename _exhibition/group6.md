Segawa Kikunojo V as Koshimoto Otaka in the play _Shiire Soga Karigane-zome_ (A new Soga Brothers design dyed in the Karigane Gang style) performed at the Nakamura Theatre in 01/1820

Private collection

This print is probably part of a triptych. It depicts a scene from one of the many plays performed at New Year based on the popular story of the revenge of the Soga brothers, in this case with a plot connected to that of the plays based on _Karigane gonin otoko_ (Karigane's 'Five Chivalrous Men' Gang), the story of the outlaw Karigane and his gang.

Private collection

From the set An Imagined Confrontation of the Three Theatres (_San shibai mitate taimen_), which shows the leading actors of the three competing Edo theatres as the cast for an imagined performance of the most popular of all Kabuki revenge tales. Soga no Juro is paired in this set with his mistress Oiso no Tora Gozen. The hero is shown wearing a monks robe and holding a monks hat. His kimono is decorated with the same flying-plovers pattern as his mistresss. Tossho I (later called Gennosuke II) was noted for his skill in portraying refined young men.

This portrait combines his elegant bearing with a sense of his grim determination to be revenged. The role of Juros mistress was in the popular category of steadfast courtesan. It allowed the female-role actor to display the breadth of his acting ability in lyric passages, scenes of amorous dalliance, gentle solicitude, grim determination and farce. Kikunojo V wears the full robes and luxurious hair ornaments of a courtesan. His pose is flirtatious, with the bundle of tissues representing an invitation to erotic dalliance. This was probably the last print of Kikunojo to be issued before his death in 01/1832 at the age of 30.

Private collection

From the set of nine designs entitled _Tosei oshi-e hagoita atari kyogen no uchii_ (Modern cloth-picture battledores stage hits).

Danjuro VII is depicted as Soga no Goro in _Yanone_ (The arrow-sharpener), one of the popular plays based on the story of the revenge of the Soga brothers on their father's murderer, Suketsune. This virtuoso role was performed in the most extravagant 'rough stuff' (_aragoto_) style of acting developed by the [Danjuro lineage](/themes/actors-names-and-crests) of actors. It allowed Danjuro VII to display his mastery in the portrayal of swash-buckling heroes. The striking face-paint, which is typical of such heroic roles, expresses the intensity of the character's feelings. In this instance the hero, burning with rage, sharpens a double-tipped arrow with which he and his brother intend to avenge their father's murder.

_Kunisada 39_

Given by the Friends of the Fitzwilliam with the aid of the MGC Purchase Grant Fund and the National Art Collections Fund.

Portrait of [Ichikawa Danjuro VIII](/exhibition/group-12) as Soga no Goro, from the series Mitate juni-ka-getsu (Comparisons with the Twelve Months).

The portrait is depicted as though the face is painted on a lantern, and is accompanied by an inset designed by Kunisada II (1823-80) showing a figure running in a sudden evening shower. Plays telling of the revenge taken by the Soga no Goro and his brother Soga no Juro on their father's murderer were traditionally performed at New Year, but there were also quick-change dance pieces (_henge mono_) devoted to single characters, which were performed at other times of year. One of these was _Ame no Goro_ ('Rainfall Goro') or _Tokimune_ first created in 1841 for a festival honouring the Soga brothers.

Its story involves Goro's visit to the pleasure quarters to visit his mistress during a rain-storm. He wears a richly-embroidered robe with the butterfly motif associated with the character, and the sort of red make-up (_beni guma_) and wild-haired wig typical of the _aragoto_ ('rough-stuff') roles specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage of actors.

Each actor in this series is matched with a month; the connection in this print may be that the revenge in the Soga story took place in the fifth month. The iris is the symbol of the Fifth Month.

_Kunisada 70_

c. 1818-20

Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

From a set of five [surimono](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) commissioned for the Hisakataya poetry group whose emblem, a stylised _koto_ bridge, surmounts the red inscription: _Goban-tsusuki_ (from a set of five). The printer's seal of _Ryusai_ _Chimata_ (Ino Naojiro) also appears on the print. The set depicts characters from the cycle of plays telling of the revenge of the two Soga brothers, Soga no Juro and Soga no Goro, on their father's murderer Kudo Suketsune.

The _Iori-mokko_ motif (a magnolia within a stylised hut) associated with Kudo Suketsune decorates the curtain looped across the top of all five prints in the series. It also occurs on the curtain on the _Shimadai_ (island tray) decoration held by Oiso no Tora in this print. The motif alludes to Suketsune's hunting lodge at Susono below Mount Fuji, where he was finally murdered by the Soga brothers. Soga no Juro's costume bears the pattern of flying-plovers (_chidori_) that was traditionally associated with him, while his sleeve is decorated with the _Yamagata-mokko_ motif of Soga. His mistress Tora's costume is decorated with a Soga butterfly motif, which was also associated with the actor Kumesaburo

**Ichikawa Danjuro VII as Soga no Goro and Bando Mitsugoro III as Asaina no Saburo in the armour-pulling scene (_kusazuribiku_)**{: .text-info }    

_Kunisada 81_  

1827 Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

A [surimono](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) of the famous armour-pulling scene (_kusazuribiki_) which had become a highpoint of various Kabuki plays telling of the revenge of the two Soga brothers, Soga no Juro and Soga no Goro, on their fathers murderer Kudo Suketsune. Soga no Goro, believing his brother to be in mortal danger, rushes out from hiding to his defence, only to be held back by the legendary strongman warrior Asaina no Saburo (1176-?) tugging at the skirt of his armour. Goro was said to have held his ground like a guardian statue. This print probably depicts an imaginary performance of a Soga brothers vendetta play, as these actors did not appear in these roles in 1827.

Danjuros costume bears the Soga butterfly crest, while his sword-hilt is decorated with the Ichikawa acting crest (_[mon](/themes/actors-names-and-crests)_) of three concentric boxes, or triple-rice-measure (_[mimasu](/themes/actors-names-and-crests)_). Mitsugoros acting crest (_mon_)a circle containing the triple-stroke character for threedecorates his costume.

The first poem puns on the verb _hikeru_, which can refer either to trailing mists or tugging. The other poem likens the curling leaves of springtime bracken ferns to clenched fists.

_Kunisada 63_

Given by David Scrase 1994

Published in 12/1861 as part of the series _Tosei jihitsu kagami_ (Mirror of Contemporary Autographs).

From the series _Tosei jihitsu kagami_ (Mirror of Contemporary Autographs), published 12/1861, with portraits by Kunisada juxtaposed against landscapes or still-lifes designed sometimes by Hiroshige or (in this case) by his pupil Ichiyusai Shigenobu, known as Hiroshige II (1826-69).

This print was evidently intended as advance publicity for the appearance of Bando Hikosaburo in this role at the Nakamura theatre in New Year of 1862. A New Year _hokku_ poem, signed in imitation of the actor's own calligraphy, appears down the right on the _tanzaku_ (long poem card):

> A blessing to the branches
which still do not sprout
the east wind of spring.

**Ichikawa Danjuro VII as a medicine seller in front of a cartouche of Danjuro IV as Kagekiyo**
_Kunisada 71_

Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

This [surimono](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) is sealed beneath Kunisada's signature with the artist's _sada_ seal in the form of the _mimasu_ (triple-rice-measure) box which was the Ichikawa lineage acting crest [(_mon_).](/themes/actors-names-and-crests) It also bears the [production seal](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) of Kubo Shumman (1757-1820), indicating that Kunisada's design was cut and printed by the Shumman studio. It was commissioned by the Go poetry group, whose stylised symbol made up of the character for 'five' (_go_) is used as the pattern on the upper part of Danjuro IV's outer robe.

The surimono may have been intended as a memorial to Danjuro IV, and celebrates roles which were specialities of the Ichikawa lineage of actors. _Kagekiyo_ was revived and revised by Danjuro IV and included by Danjuro VII in his selection of Eighteen Plays (_Kabuki Juhachiban_) specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage. The Ichikawa _[mimasu](/themes/actors-names-and-crests)_ [crest (_mon_)](/themes/actors-names-and-crests) is seen on the hilt of Danjuro IV's sword. He holds in a bag the precious _biwa_ (lute) called Seizan, which Kagekiyo is hiding from his Genji enemies.

Danjuro VII is shown in the foreground holding a fan in one hand, which is embossed with the silver triple stripe (_misuji_) associated with the Ichikawa lineage. In the other hand he holds a medicine packet bearing the character _uira\[u\]_, referring to the medicine _uiro_, which was supposed to cure everything from constipation to bad breath. The larger black case on his back has the characters for \[O\]dawara, the place where the medicine was produced. _Uiro_ sellers were famous for their high-pitched voices and rapid sales-talk. Danjuro II, celebrated for his elocution, incorporated a _uiro_ seller into a play on a Soga theme in 1718 (_Wakamidori ikioi Soga_), in which he is actually Soga no Juro in disguise. Danjuro VII wears the costume associated with this role: decorated with lucky coins and with a lining motif of sacred _shimenawa_ ropes and dangling paper streamers. He later incorporated the role into a performance of _Sukeroku yukari no Edo zakura_ (Sukeroku's affinity for the cherry blossoms of Edo), in which he passed the Danjuro name onto his ten-year-old son, who became [Danjuro VIII.](/exhibition/group-12)

The poem on the surimono by Dokurakudo Takamori weaves into a standard New Year _kyoka_ an allusion to the famed verbal gymnastics of the _uiro_ seller, which in the play were supposedly due to the piece of _uiro_ that he had put into his mouth:

_Saku ume no_ With the scent of plum _kaori fukumeba_ blossoms filling its mouth,_ima masa ni_ the warbler in the courtyard _shita yoku mawaru_ is now readied to recite _yado no uguisu_ its elegant tongue-twisters.
