Ichikawa Danjuro VII as Fuwa Banzaemon (right), Onoe Kikugoro III as Nagoya Sanza (centre) and Segawa Kikunojo V as the courtesan Katsuragi (left)in _Ukiyo-zuka hiyoku no inazuma_ (Ukiyo's sword hilt, a double grave mound and the mark of the lightning bolt) performed at the Ichimura theatre in 03/1823**Private collection

This famous _Saya-ate_ ('Scabbards clashing') confrontation scene occurs in the third act of the play, which was written for these performers and first performed in this production in 1823. The idea derived both from the established Kabuki convention of a _Saya-ate_ scene, and from the 1807 novel by Santo Kyoden, _Mukashi banashi inazuma hyoshi_ (An Old Time Lightning Bolt Tale). Fuwa Banzaemon carries a sword named **'Thunder'** and wears a kimono decorated with a pattern of **'lightning-in-the-clouds'**.

His rival Nagoya Sanzaburo (Sanza for short) carries a sword named 'Amorous Swallows' and wears a kimono decorated with a 'swallows-in-the-rain' pattern. Unaware of each other, they make simultaneous entrances along the two raised passageways (_hanamichi_) through the audience. As they pass on the main stage (which represents Nakano Street in the Yoshiwara pleasure district at cherry blossom time), their sword hilts clash. They exchange insults, remove their green sedge travelling-hats, recognize one another and draw swords to fight over the courtesan Katsuragi. Katsuragi rushes forward and persuades them to call a truce.

**Ichikawa Danjuro VII as Fuwa Banzaemon (right) and Onoe Kikugoro III as Nagoya Sanza in _Sato no haru meibutsu amigasa_ (Famous sedge hats during spring in Yoshiwara) performed at the Kawarazaki theatre in 01/1827**

Given to the Fitzwilliam Museum by E. Evelyn Barron in 1937

A [surimono](/context/textP) diptych showing the famous Scabbards clashing (_Saya-ate_) scene in a revival (with a different name) of the play that first brought Danjuro VII and Kikugoro III together in these highly successful roles in 1823. This scene was subsequently performed as a separate dance-drama. Fuwa Banzaemon carries a sword named Thunder and wears a kimono decorated with a pattern of lightning-in-the-clouds.

His rival Nagoya Sanza carries a sword named Amorous Swallows and wears a kimono with a swallows-in-the-rain pattern tied with a sash of knitted rope. Unaware of each other, they make simultaneous entrances boasting of their fame, along the two raised passageways (_hanamichi_) that run through the audience to the main stage. As they pass on the main stage, which represents Nakano Street in the Yoshiwara pleasure district at cherry blossom time, their sword hilts clash  a breach of etiquette demanding an apology. This depiction shows them at the moment when they raise their deep sedge traveling-hats and recognize each other, before drawing swords to fight over the courtesan Katsuragi, whom they both love.

It seems that Danjuro VII was only recruited for this performance after a fire prevented him from appearing as Kagekiyo at the Ichimura theatre
