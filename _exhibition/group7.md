**Prints from a set depicting _Saruwaka hisago no gumbai_ (Saruwaka's gourd-crested battle fan) performed at the Nakamura Theatre in 11/1820**  

Private collection

Four prints from the series are displayed here, only two of which are known in other impressions. These were Kunisada's first _oban_ (standard-format) half-length portraits for four years, with the exception of fan portraits. In each print in this series, the subtlety of the printing in relation to the design is evident in the use of diluted black ink for the calligraphic strokes that define the kimono and sash as well as the actor's name and role, the artist's signature, the censor's seal and the publisher's mark. As an added refinement, the poem in the actor's own hand is printed in colour set off by the delicate pink ground. This was the first time that a poem by the featured actor had been included on commercially issued actor-portraits. Such poems became a standard feature of Kunisada's half-length actor portraits, and are found on 110 of the 200 portraits issued between 1820 and 1840 (although they are never encountered on commercially issued full-figure actor prints).  

The Saruwaka in the title of the play is Saruwaka Kanzaburo, who was given official permission by the Shogun to open the [Saruwaka Theatre](/themes/saruwaka-street) (later renamed Nakamura when the family name changed), the first Kabuki theatre in Edo. The title thereby associates this performance with the Nakamura theatre. The 'gourd-crest' in the title belonged to the great warlord Hideyoshi, an indication that the play was one of the _Taikoki mono_ (plays about the _taiko_), telling the story of the sixteenth-century warlord Hideyoshi, but with changed names. The identity of such historical characters was disguised to avoid infringing the ban on their portrayal on stage or in prints.

_Kunisada 4_  

Private collection  

From a set of ten prints entitled _Hotarugari Edokko soroi_ (Firefly catching a line-up of Edo folk), depicting actors in the roles of typical Edo characters dressed for a summer firefly hunt. This impression is from a limited deluxe printing. It is on thicker paper than usual and employs more subtle pigments than those encountered in standard commercially issued prints.

The nuances of printing enhance the impact of the graceful design, with its lilting sense of arrested motion. Particularly effective is the wiping of colour blocks to allow one colour to shade gradually into another. The [purple patch](/themes/fan-prints-two) covering Kikunojo V's shaved pate and his coarse features identified him as a man, yet in dress and deportment he represented the essence of femininity.

The butterfly that decorates his fan is the identifying feature of the [crest (_mon_)](/themes/actors-names-and-crests) of the Kikunojo lineage of actors.

_Kunisada 31_

From the 1820s to 1860s memorial portraits featured regularly in the output of Edo publishers, many of them designed by Kunisada. He even produced more than one design of the same actor for competing publishers. The prints generally gave the actor's stage name, date of death, age at the time of death, his 'farewell poem', funereal name, and the temple that would be entrusted with his remains. The deceased was depicted out of role sometimes in formal dress, sometimes in a Buddhist monk's robes (or nun's robes if they specialised in female-roles).

Whereas all other memorial prints of the 1820s and 30s showed the deceased full-figure (standing or seated), this print is exceptional in depicting the noted [female-role actor (_onnagata_)](/themes/fan-prints-two) Segawa Kikunojo V half-length. He is shown in female attire and simple woman's coiffure with a square cloth covering his shaved forehead. Rather than holding the customary prayer beads, he is shown holding a packet of the leading face powder of the day. Such 'product placement' was rare in actor prints, but was often encountered in prints of beautiful women.

The stylised butterflies decorating the black frame of this print and ornamenting Kikunojo's hairpin would have been recognised as the actor's crest [(_mon_)](/themes/actors-names-and-crests) of Kikunojo; butterflies were also taken to represent the soul of the recently deceased.

This print is probably part of a triptych. It depicts a scene from one of the many plays performed at New Year based on the popular story of the revenge of the [Soga brothers,](/exhibition/group-6) in this case with a plot connected to that of the plays based on _Karigane gonin otoko_ (Karigane's 'Five Chivalrous Men' Gang), the story of the outlaw Karigane and his gang.

This triptych captures the interplay between the three characters at a climactic moment in the play. The text around them records their dialogue in the scene, revealing that the geisha Kokin and her lover Hikoso are making their escape from the licensed quarters. Tamasho tries to dissuade couple from taking such a tragic course of action. In the mid 1820s there was a brief vogue for filling the background of half-length and full-figure actor portraits with extended texts (see also the diptych included in this exhibition). This device was derived from inexpensive, illustrated popular novels, in which text filled all the space around the figures. Kunisada was an experienced illustrator of such novels and often drew the characters with actors' features.

This famous _[Saya-ate](/exhibition/group-4)_ [('Scabbards clashing') confrontation scene](/exhibition/group-4) occurs in the third act of the play, which was written for these performers and first performed in this production in 1823. The idea derived both from the established Kabuki convention of a _Saya-ate_ scene, and from the 1807 novel by Santo Kyoden, _Mukashi banashi inazuma hyoshi_ (An Old Time Lightning Bolt Tale). Fuwa Banzaemon carries a sword named 'Thunder' and wears a kimono decorated with a pattern of 'lightning-in-the-clouds'. His rival Nagoya Sanzaburo (Sanza for short) carries a sword named 'Amorous Swallows' and wears a kimono decorated with a 'swallows-in-the-rain' pattern. Unaware of each other, they make simultaneous entrances along the two raised passageways (_hanamichi_) through the audience. As they pass on the main stage (which represents Nakano Street in the Yoshiwara pleasure district at cherry blossom time), their sword hilts clash. They exchange insults, remove their green sedge travelling-hats, recognize one another and draw swords to fight over the courtesan Katsuragi. Katsuragi rushes forward and persuades them to call a truce.

Ichikawa [Danjuro VII](/themes/actors-names-and-crests) is revealed here in his [dressing room,](/exhibition/group-13) chatting with the [female-role](/themes/fan-prints-two) actor Segawa Kikunojo V. Three assistants are dressing Danjuro in the bulky costume of the lead role of Kamakura Gongoro in _[Shibaraku!](/exhibition/group-2)_ (Stop right there!). He has already put on the elaborate make-up required for the role. Two servants struggle to tighten his armour and jacket, while another servant on the right brings in the giant trousers (_hakama_). The great eight-foot sword that he will carry over his shoulder is seen resting against the wall behind him.

This book appeared in four volumes and provided meticulously rendered views of actors on and off stage, with a text discussing leading actors and their predecessors. It is remarkable for its restrained yet rich palette. A book like this would cost considerably more than a single-sheet colour print. It was intended for the wealthier connoisseurs of the Kabuki theatre.

A surimono showing a scene from a play based on the subject of the Eternal Couple from the Legend of Takasago. Jo and Uba were supposed to have fallen in love when young, and after living to a very old age their spirits came to abide in pine trees, one on the beach at Takasago in Harima, and the other at Sumiyoshi in Sesshu near Osaka. Their spirits returned on moonlit nights in human form with rakes to continue their work of clearing the pine needles on Takasago Beach. The legend inspired the No play _Takasago,_ and was subsequently taken up by Kabuki, especially in the celebratory _Takasago mono_ (Takasago dances), a line of celebratory dances, such as _Takasago tanzen_, premiered in 1785. In this print the actors are holding No masks.

The Eternal Couple were a popular subject in art. They are usually shown, Jo with a rake and Uba with a broom, sweeping pine needles, which symbolise longevity, an appropriate wish for surimono intended as New Year gifts.

The producer's seal of [Suriko Kozen](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) appears on the print.

Spring _kyoka_ [surimono](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) commemorating the performance in the ninth month of 1832 at the Kawarazaki Theatre in Edo of _Sugawara denju tenarai kagami_ (Sugawara and the secrets of calligraphy). The print shows the _Tempaizan_ scene at Mount Tempai on Kyushu, where the exiled Sugawara, known as Kan Shojo, learns in a dream that his favourite plum tree from the garden in his home in Sada village has been moved to nearby Anraku Temple so that he may enjoy its blossoms. When he goes there he encounters one of his retainers, Umeomaru, involved in a duel. He breaks off a branch from the tree and magically decapitates Umeomaru's opponent. He then learns from Umeomaru that his loss of position at court and subsequent exile are due to the machinations of his rival Shihei (Fujiwara Tokihira). Flying into a rage he turns into the Thunder god, raises a storm and, to the accompaniment of lightning, flies off to the capital (Kyoto) to muster support in preventing Shihei from gaining power.

The print conflates the scene of the duel with Kan Shojo's transformation into the Thunder God. The poems include images of blossoms of plum (_umeo_), and Umeomaru's jacket is decorated with the flower. Kan Shojo was one of Danjuro's most celebrated roles. Almost twenty years earlier Kunisada designed a print of him in the role with the branch of plum blossom clenched between his teeth, in a set of 'Great Performances'.

This unsigned [surimono](/themes/surimono-and-special-printing-effects) may be part of a diptych, with the signature on the missing right-hand sheet, and/or part of a series that involves comparisons with insects. Here the sound of the shrine dancer's _suzu_ bells (lying on the ground), and the ringed staff held by the pilgrim are compared to the sound of insects. The roles and play have yet to be identified.
