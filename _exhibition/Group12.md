Private collection

This diptych commemorates the debut of Danjuro VII's eldest son in the central role of this play. The role is one of the great examples of the 'rough-stuff' style (_aragoto_) for which the Ichikawa line of actors was famous. Danjuro VIII is striking a defiant pose on the raised passageway (_hanamichi_) leading from the back of the theatre through the audience to the main stage, while his father, playing the role of the villain, looks on from the main stage.

This is the great moment when Narita Goro, on the point of executing the innocent Yoshitsuna and his fiance, is halted by the powerful voice of Gongoro coming from the rear of the theatre shouting _'Shibaraku! Shibaraku!'_ ('Stop right there!'). The hero then strides onto the _hanamichi_ wearing the most extravagant _aragoto_ costume: a voluminous _suo_ ('plain sliding-door') robe, with the Danjuro _[mon](/themes/actors-names-and-crests)_ adorning square sleeves so wide that they have to be supported with splints. Laudatory poems fill the space above the figures. This impression, the only known surviving example of this diptych, has faded: the thick cord around Danjuro VIII's neck was originally bright red, and the thin cord was purple.

Portrait of Ichikawa Danjuro VIII as [Soga no Goro,](/exhibition/group-6) from the series Mitate juni-ka-getsu (Comparisons with the Twelve Months).

The portrait is depicted as though the face is painted on a lantern, and is accompanied by an inset designed by Kunisada II (1823-80) showing a figure running in a sudden evening shower. Plays telling of the [revenge](/exhibition/group-6) taken by the Soga no Goro and his brother Soga no Juro on their father's murderer were traditionally performed at New Year, but there were also quick-change dance pieces (_henge mono_) devoted to single characters, which were performed at other times of year. One of these was _Ame no Goro_ ('Rainfall Goro') or _Tokimune_ first created in 1841 for a festival honouring the Soga brothers. Its story involves Goro's visit to the pleasure quarters to visit his mistress during a rain-storm. He wears a richly-embroidered robe with the butterfly motif associated with the character, and the sort of red make-up (_beni guma_) and wild-haired wig typical of the _aragoto_ ('rough-stuff') roles specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage of actors.

Each actor in this series is matched with a month; the connection in this print may be that the revenge in the Soga story took place in the fifth month. The iris is the symbol of the Fifth Month.

Portrait of [Ichikawa Danjuro VIII](/themes/ichikawa-danjuro-VIII) as Arajishi Otokonosuke with an inset portrait of Matsumoto Koshiro V as Nikki Danjo in _Date kurabe Okuni Kabuki_ (A competition in ostentation: Okuni's Kabuki), from the series _Nazorae eto-awase_ (Allusions to the Zodiac Signs).

This series matches the roles played by actors to signs of the zodiac. In this print the reference to the zodiac sign for the rat is evident to those with a knowledge of the _Yukashita_ ('Under the floor of the Palace') scene of the play. The evil samurai Nikki Danjo (shown in the inset) transformed himself into a giant rat and in this guise he snatches a precious scroll and runs away with it in his mouth to hide beneath the palace floorboards. In the ensuing scene under the floor, the loyal samurai Arajishi Otokonosuke (the main figure in the print) uses his iron fan to strike the rat on the forehead. The rat is then transformed into his true self, disappearing through a trap door out of which Nikki is seen to rise, with the scroll still held in his mouth and a crescent-shaped wound from the blow on his forehead. He floats into the air and disappears into a cloud in the upper reaches of the theatre, with Otokonosuke posturing in _aragoto_ ('rough-stuff') style on the main stage below. These stage postions are reflected in the design of this print.

A print of the same scene was published four months earlier in a zodiac series designed by Kuniyoshi, illustrating the cast of a performance in 1851. Kunisada's print depicts an imaginary perfromance with a 'dream cast', in which the current star Danjuro VIII appears with Koshiro V, who had died in 1838, some fourteen years before this print was published. Koshiro was the most famous Nikki in history (his 1818 performance opposite Danjuro VII in this scene was recorded in a diptych by Kunisada published in that year). Even today actors playing Nikki wear Koshiro's crest and costume pattern, and they use make-up to recreate the large spot that Koshiro had above his left eyebrow.

A portrait of [Ichikawa Danjuro VIII](/themes/ichikawa-danjuro-VIII) as [Kagekiyo,](/exhibition/group-14) with a view of Miya on the [Tokaido Highway](/exhibition/group-1) in the background, from the [series](KUN/kunp62.htm) _Tokaido gojusan tsugi no uchi_ (Fifty-three stations of the Tokaido Highway).

Akushichibyoe Kagekiyo, a leading Heike warrior in the Gempei wars, featured only briefly in the historical chronicle _Heike Monogatari_ (Tale of the Heike) but assumed great prominence in legend and in numerous kabuki and puppet dramas known as _Kagekiyo mono_ (Kagekiyo plays). One version was included by Danjuro VII in his selection of Eighteen Plays (_Kabuki Juhachiban_) specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage. The role called for the Ichikawa speciality of _aragoto_ ('rough-stuff') acting, with a _dotera_ (padded-dressing-gown) costume, huge bushy wig and red make-up (_beni suji_) with _suji gama_ ('line shadows') and painted blue beard (_han guma_).

As with all the prints in this series (two of them included here), the landscape in the background is heavily indebted to a print in Hiroshige's famous series of Tokaido views published 20 years earlier.
